Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return `true` if `s` is a `k`**-palindrome**.

A string is `k`**-palindrome** if it can be transformed into a palindrome by removing at most `k` characters from it.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "abcdeca", k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: Remove 'b' and 'e' characters.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "abbababa", k = 1
Output: true
```

**Constraints:**
-   `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
-   `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
-   `1 <= k <= s.length`


**Solution:**

- [x] [[Dynamic Programming]] + [[Bottom-Up Solution]]

**Intuition** :

How do we find the minimum characters to be removed to make it a palindrome? Let's imagine matching the characters of the string like a palindrome, from the beginning and the end with 2 pointers `i` and `j`. We may encounter the following two scenarios:

1.  The character at `i` matches character at `j`.
2.  The characters don't match each other.

For case 1 we just increase the pointer `i` and decrease the pointer `j`, `i++` and `j--` respectively.
In the second case we have 2 options:

-   Remove character at `j` and see if the previous character matches character at `i`.
Or
-   Remove character at `i` and see if the next character matches character at `j`.

Since we are not actually removing the characters from the string but just calculating the number of characters to be removed, in case 1 we decrement the pointer `j` by 1 and `i` stays as it is, as we still need a character to match character at `i` and in case 2 we increment the pointer `i` by 1 and `j` stays as it is, as we still need a character to match character at `j`. In both the cases we remove 1 character and thus it adds 1 to the cost.

We can then use these two different pairs of new `i` and `j` values (`i+1, j` and `i, j-1`) to again repeat the process and get the minimum result of them as our result for current pair `i, j`.

```java
    public boolean isValidPalindrome(String source, int deletions) {
        
        int len = source.length();
        char[] order = source.toCharArray(),
               reverseOrder = new StringBuilder(source).reverse().toString().toCharArray();
        
        int[][] store = new int[len + 1][len + 1];
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= len; i++)
            for (int j = 1; j <= len; j++)
                if (order[i - 1] == reverseOrder[j - 1])
                    store[i][j] = store[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                else
                    store[i][j] = Math.max(store[i - 1][j], store[i][j - 1]);
        
        int reqDeletions = len - store[len][len];
        return reqDeletions <= deletions;
    }
```
