A **path** in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence **at most once**. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The **path sum** of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the maximum **path sum** of any **non-empty** path_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/13/exx1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/13/exx2.jpg)

```
Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 42
Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.
```

**Constraints:**

-   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 3 * 104]`.
-   `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`


**Solution:**

- [x] [[Depth First Search]]

**Intuition** :

-   A path from start to end, goes up on the tree for 0 or more steps, then goes down for 0 or more steps. Once it goes down, it can't go up. Each path has a highest node, which is also the lowest common ancestor of all other nodes on the path.
-   A recursive method `maxPathDown(TreeNode node)` (1) computes the maximum path sum with highest node is the input node, update maximum if necessary (2) returns the maximum sum of the path that can be extended to input node's parent.
