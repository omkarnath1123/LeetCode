Tag : **Hard**<br>
Lock: **Normal**

Your car starts at position `0` and speed `+1` on an infinite number line. Your car can go into negative positions. Your car drives automatically according to a sequence of instructions `'A'` (accelerate) and `'R'` (reverse):

-   When you get an instruction `'A'`, your car does the following:
    -   `position += speed`
    -   `speed *= 2`
-   When you get an instruction `'R'`, your car does the following:
    -   If your speed is positive then `speed = -1`
    -   otherwise `speed = 1`Your position stays the same.

For example, after commands `"AAR"`, your car goes to positions `0 --> 1 --> 3 --> 3`, and your speed goes to `1 --> 2 --> 4 --> -1`.

Given a target position `target`, return _the length of the shortest sequence of instructions to get there_.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The shortest instruction sequence is "AA".
Your position goes from 0 --> 1 --> 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: target = 6
Output: 5
Explanation: 
The shortest instruction sequence is "AAARA".
Your position goes from 0 --> 1 --> 3 --> 7 --> 7 --> 6.
```

**Constraints:**
-   `1 <= target <= 104`

**Solution:**
- [x] [[Breath First Search]]

**Intuition** :
Well, the BFS solution is straightforward: we can keep track of all the possible positions of the race-car after `n` instructions (`n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...`) and return the smallest `n` such that the target position is reached. Naive BFS will run at `O(2^n)` since for each position we have two choices: either accelerate or reverse. Further observations reveal that there may be overlapping among intermediate states so we need to memorize visited states (each state is characterised by two integers: car position and car speed). However, the total number of unique states still blows up for large target positions (because the position and speed can grow unbounded), so we need further pruning of the search space.

target = the target no

**Time Complexity** : O(target *log(target))<br>
**Space Complexity** : O(target)

```java
    public int racecar(int target) {
        
        int limit = target << 1;
        Node start = new Node(0, 1);
        Set<String> visited = new HashSet<>();
        Deque<Node> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.add(start);
        
        for (int depth = 0; !queue.isEmpty(); depth++)
            for (int i = queue.size(); i > 0; i--) {
                Node poll = queue.pollFirst();
                if (poll.index == target)
                    return depth;
                
                Node accelerate = new Node(poll.index + poll.speed, poll.speed << 1),
                     reverse = new Node(poll.index, poll.speed > 0 ? -1 : 1);
                
                if (!visited.contains(accelerate.hash()) && 
                    accelerate.index > 0 && 
                    accelerate.index < limit) {
                    visited.add(accelerate.hash());
                    queue.offerLast(accelerate);
                }
                if (!visited.contains(reverse.hash()) && 
                    reverse.index > 0 && 
                    reverse.index < limit) {
                    visited.add(reverse.hash());
                    queue.offerLast(reverse);
                }
            }
        
        return -1;
    }
    class Node {
        int index, speed;
        Node (int index, int speed) {
            this.index = index;
            this.speed = speed;
        }
        public String hash() {
            return index + "|" + speed;
        }
    }
