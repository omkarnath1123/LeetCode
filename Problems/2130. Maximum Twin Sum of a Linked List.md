Link: [2130. Maximum Twin Sum of a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-twin-sum-of-a-linked-list/) <br>
Tag : **Medium**<br>
Lock: **Normal**

In a linked list of size `n`, where `n` is **even**, the `ith` node (**0-indexed**) of the linked list is known as the **twin** of the `(n-1-i)th` node, if `0 <= i <= (n / 2) - 1`.

-   For example, if `n = 4`, then node `0` is the twin of node `3`, and node `1` is the twin of node `2`. These are the only nodes with twins for `n = 4`.

The **twin sum** is defined as the sum of a node and its twin.

Given the `head` of a linked list with even length, return _the **maximum twin sum** of the linked list_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/03/eg1drawio.png)
```
Input: head = [5,4,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation:
Nodes 0 and 1 are the twins of nodes 3 and 2, respectively. All have twin sum = 6.
There are no other nodes with twins in the linked list.
Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is 6. 
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/03/eg2drawio.png)
```
Input: head = [4,2,2,3]
Output: 7
Explanation:
The nodes with twins present in this linked list are:
- Node 0 is the twin of node 3 having a twin sum of 4 + 3 = 7.
- Node 1 is the twin of node 2 having a twin sum of 2 + 2 = 4.
Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is max(7, 4) = 7. 
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/03/eg3drawio.png)
```
Input: head = [1,100000]
Output: 100001
Explanation:
There is only one node with a twin in the linked list having twin sum of 1 + 100000 = 100001.
```

**Constraints:**
-   The number of nodes in the list is an **even** integer in the range `[2, 105]`.
-   `1 <= Node.val <= 105`

**Solution:**
- [x] [[Linked-List]]

**Intuition** :
O(n) memory solution is trivial, so no fun in that.
We could use slow and fast pointers to determine the middle of the list. We then reverse the list starting from the middle, so we can easily iterate through twins.
Note that we can do the reversal again to restore the original list (omitted for simplicity).

```
n = length of list

        for (ListNode one = head, two = reverse; 
             one != null; 
             one = one.next, two = two.next)
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, one.val + two.val);
        return maxSum;
