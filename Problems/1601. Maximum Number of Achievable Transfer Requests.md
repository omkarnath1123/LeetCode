Link: [1601. Maximum Number of Achievable Transfer Requests](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-achievable-transfer-requests/) <br>
Tag : **Hard**<br>
Lock: **Normal**

We have `n` buildings numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. Each building has a number of employees. It's transfer season, and some employees want to change the building they reside in.

You are given an array `requests` where `requests[i] = [fromi, toi]` represents an employee's request to transfer from building `fromi` to building `toi`.

**All buildings are full**, so a list of requests is achievable only if for each building, the **net change in employee transfers is zero**. This means the number of employees **leaving** is **equal** to the number of employees **moving in**. For example if `n = 3` and two employees are leaving building `0`, one is leaving building `1`, and one is leaving building `2`, there should be two employees moving to building `0`, one employee moving to building `1`, and one employee moving to building `2`.

Return _the maximum number of achievable requests_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/10/move1.jpg)
```
Input: n = 5, requests = [[0,1],[1,0],[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[3,4]]
Output: 5
Explantion: Let's see the requests:
From building 0 we have employees x and y and both want to move to building 1.
From building 1 we have employees a and b and they want to move to buildings 2 and 0 respectively.
From building 2 we have employee z and they want to move to building 0.
From building 3 we have employee c and they want to move to building 4.
From building 4 we don't have any requests.
We can achieve the requests of users x and b by swapping their places.
We can achieve the requests of users y, a and z by swapping the places in the 3 buildings.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/10/move2.jpg)
```
Input: n = 3, requests = [[0,0],[1,2],[2,1]]
Output: 3
Explantion: Let's see the requests:
From building 0 we have employee x and they want to stay in the same building 0.
From building 1 we have employee y and they want to move to building 2.
From building 2 we have employee z and they want to move to building 1.
We can achieve all the requests. 
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: n = 4, requests = [[0,3],[3,1],[1,2],[2,0]]
Output: 4

```

**Constraints:**
-   `1 <= n <= 20`
-   `1 <= requests.length <= 16`
-   `requests[i].length == 2`
-   `0 <= fromi, toi < n`

**Solution:**

- [x] [[Backtracking]]

**Intuition** :
Iterating all possibilities by backtracking. (Choose or Not Choose)  
Count the incoming and outgoing paths for each building  
Check if all the buildings have the count of 0 (means incoming and outgoing paths are balanced according to the question description)

```
n = n
m = is the length of requests

**Time Complexity** : O(n*2<sup>m</sup>)<br>
**Space Complexity** : O(m)

```java
    int maxTasks;
    public int maximumRequests(int n, int[][] requests) {
        maxTasks = 0;
        backTrack(0, new int[n], requests, 0);
        return maxTasks;
    }
    private void backTrack(int index, int[] buildings, int[][] requests, int tasks) {
        int len = requests.length;
        if (index == len) {
            for (int people : buildings)
                if (people != 0)
                    return;
            maxTasks = Math.max(maxTasks, tasks);
            return;
        }
        
        int[] request = requests[index];
        buildings[request[0]]--;
        buildings[request[1]]++;
        backTrack(index + 1, buildings, requests, tasks + 1);
        buildings[request[1]]--;
        buildings[request[0]]++;

        backTrack(index + 1, buildings, requests, tasks);
    }
```
