Tag : **Medium**<br>
Lock: **Premium**

You are playing a game that has `n` levels numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `damage` where `damage[i]` is the amount of health you will lose to complete the `ith` level.

You are also given an integer `armor`. You may use your armor ability **at most once** during the game on **any** level which will protect you from **at most** `armor` damage.

You must complete the levels in order and your health must be **greater than** `0` at all times to beat the game.

Return _the **minimum** health you need to start with to beat the game._

**Example 1:**
```
Input: damage = [2,7,4,3], armor = 4
Output: 13
Explanation: One optimal way to beat the game starting at 13 health is:
On round 1, take 2 damage. You have 13 - 2 = 11 health.
On round 2, take 7 damage. You have 11 - 7 = 4 health.
On round 3, use your armor to protect you from 4 damage. You have 4 - 0 = 4 health.
On round 4, take 3 damage. You have 4 - 3 = 1 health.
Note that 13 is the minimum health you need to start with to beat the game.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: damage = [2,5,3,4], armor = 7
Output: 10
Explanation: One optimal way to beat the game starting at 10 health is:
On round 1, take 2 damage. You have 10 - 2 = 8 health.
On round 2, use your armor to protect you from 5 damage. You have 8 - 0 = 8 health.
On round 3, take 3 damage. You have 8 - 3 = 5 health.
On round 4, take 4 damage. You have 5 - 4 = 1 health.
Note that 10 is the minimum health you need to start with to beat the game.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: damage = [3,3,3], armor = 0
Output: 10
Explanation: One optimal way to beat the game starting at 10 health is:
On round 1, take 3 damage. You have 10 - 3 = 7 health.
On round 2, take 3 damage. You have 7 - 3 = 4 health.
On round 3, take 3 damage. You have 4 - 3 = 1 health.
Note that you did not use your armor ability.
```

**Constraints:**
-   `n == damage.length`
-   `1 <= n <= 105`
-   `0 <= damage[i] <= 105`
-   `0 <= armor <= 105`

**Solution:**
- [x] [[Greedy]]

**Intuition** :
1.  Add all the damages to find required health (Add one to the result because the health should be greater than zero at any time)
2.  Find the maximum number out of damage array to determine which level to use the armor in.
3.  To optimally use the armor, we need to use it against the level that causes the most damage. Subtract this from the health to get the minimum required health.

```
n = length of damages
```
**Time Complexity** : O(n)<br>
**Space Complexity** : O(1)

```java
    public long minimumHealth(int[] damages, int armor) {
        
        int maxDamage = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int damage : damages) maxDamage = Math.max(damage, maxDamage);
        
        long health = 0;
        boolean usedArmor = false;
        for (int damage : damages) {
            if (damage == maxDamage && !usedArmor) {
                usedArmor = true;
                health += Math.max(0, damage - armor);
            } else
                health += damage;
        }
        return health + 1;
    }
```
