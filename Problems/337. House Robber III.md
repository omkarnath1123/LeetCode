Link: [337. House Robber III](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-iii/) <br>
Tag : **Medium**<br>
Lock: **Normal**

The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called `root`.

Besides the `root`, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary tree. It will automatically contact the police if **two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given the `root` of the binary tree, return _the maximum amount of money the thief can rob **without alerting the police**_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/rob1-tree.jpg)
```
Input: root = [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]
Output: 7
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/rob2-tree.jpg)
```
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]
Output: 9
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.
```

**Constraints:**
-   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
-   `0 <= Node.val <= 104`


**Solution:**
- [x] [[Dynamic Programming]] + [[Top-Down Solution]]

**Intuition** :
Use a helper function which receives a node and a bool variable as input, and if that variable is true, it returns the maximum amount of money the thief can rob if starting from this node and robbing this node, else returns the maximum amount of money the thief can rob if starting from this node without robbing this node.

The result of this helper function would be saved in the maps, and return from the maps when are called next time.

The basic case of the helper function should be `null` node, and in this case, it returns zero.

Finally, call the `helper(root)` in the main function, and return its value.
