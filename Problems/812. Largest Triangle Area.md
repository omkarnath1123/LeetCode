Given an array of points on the **X-Y** plane `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`, return _the area of the largest triangle that can be formed by any three different points_. Answers within `10-5` of the actual answer will be accepted.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: points = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[0,2],[2,0]]
Output: 2.00000
Explanation: The five points are shown in the above figure. The red triangle is the largest.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: points = [[1,0],[0,0],[0,1]]
Output: 0.50000
```

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= points.length <= 50`
- `-50 <= xi, yi <= 50`
- All the given points are **unique**.

**Solution:**

- [x] [[Math]]

## Detailed Intuition

We will have 3 for loops to cycle through each choice of 3 points in the array.
After, we'll need a function to calculate the area given 3 points. Here we have some options:
- We can use the Shoelace formula directly, which tells us the area given the 3 points;
- We can use Heron's formula, which requires the 3 side lengths which we can get by taking the distance of two points;
- We can use the formula `area = 0.5 * a * b * sin(C)` and calculate the angle `C` with trigonometry.

Our implementation illustrates the use of the shoelace formula.
If we did not know the shoelace formula, we could derive it for triangles with the following approach: starting with points `(px, py), (qx, qy), (rx, ry)`, the area of this triangle is the same under a translation by `(-rx, -ry)`, so that the points become `(px-rx, py-ry), (qx-rx, qy-ry), (0, 0)`.

**Time Complexity** : O(n<sup>3</sup>)<br>
**Space Complexity** : O(1)

```java
    public double largestTriangleArea(int[][] points) {
        
        int length = points.length;
        double maxArea = 0;
        int[] one, two, three;
        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++)
            for (int j = i + 1; j < length; j++)
                for (int k = j + 1; k < length; k++) {
                    one = points[i];
                    two = points[j];
                    three = points[k];

                    maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, 
                    0.5 * Math.abs(one[0]*two[1] - one[1]*two[0] +
                                   two[0]*three[1] - two[1]*three[0] + 
                                   three[0]*one[1] - three[1]*one[0]));
                }
        return maxArea;
    }
```
