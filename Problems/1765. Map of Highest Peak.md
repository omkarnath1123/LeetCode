Link: [1765. Map of Highest Peak](https://leetcode.com/problems/map-of-highest-peak/) <br>
Tag : **Medium**<br>
Lock: **Normal**

You are given an integer matrix `isWater` of size `m x n` that represents a map of **land** and **water** cells.

-   If `isWater[i][j] == 0`, cell `(i, j)` is a **land** cell.
-   If `isWater[i][j] == 1`, cell `(i, j)` is a **water** cell.

You must assign each cell a height in a way that follows these rules:

-   The height of each cell must be non-negative.
-   If the cell is a **water** cell, its height must be `0`.
-   Any two adjacent cells must have an absolute height difference of **at most** `1`. A cell is adjacent to another cell if the former is directly north, east, south, or west of the latter (i.e., their sides are touching).

Find an assignment of heights such that the maximum height in the matrix is **maximized**.

Return _an integer matrix_ `height` _of size_ `m x n` _where_ `height[i][j]` _is cell_ `(i, j)`_'s height. If there are multiple solutions, return **any** of them_.

**Example 1:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/10/screenshot-2021-01-11-at-82045-am.png)**
```
Input: isWater = [[0,1],[0,0]]
Output: [[1,0],[2,1]]
Explanation: The image shows the assigned heights of each cell.
The blue cell is the water cell, and the green cells are the land cells.
```

**Example 2:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/10/screenshot-2021-01-11-at-82050-am.png)**
```
Input: isWater = [[0,0,1],[1,0,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[1,1,0],[0,1,1],[1,2,2]]
Explanation: A height of 2 is the maximum possible height of any assignment.
Any height assignment that has a maximum height of 2 while still meeting the rules will also be accepted.
```

**Constraints:**
-   `m == isWater.length`
-   `n == isWater[i].length`
-   `1 <= m, n <= 1000`
-   `isWater[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.
-   There is at least **one** water cell.

**Solution:**
- [x] [[Breath First Search]]

**Intuition** :
-   Firstly, we fill water cells with height = 0 and start to fill from their cells.
-   We prioritise filling cells with lowest height by using BFS (using queue, first in first out).
-   Because `any two adjacent cells must have an absolute height difference of at most 1`, we can set height of neighbors maximum 1 height bigger than current cell.
