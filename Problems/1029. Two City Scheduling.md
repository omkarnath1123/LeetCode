Lock: **Normal**

A company is planning to interview `2n` people. Given the array `costs` where `costs[i] = [aCosti, bCosti]`, the cost of flying the `ith` person to city `a` is `aCosti`, and the cost of flying the `ith` person to city `b` is `bCosti`.

Return _the minimum cost to fly every person to a city_ such that exactly `n` people arrive in each city.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: costs = [[10,20],[30,200],[400,50],[30,20]]
Output: 110
Explanation: 
The first person goes to city A for a cost of 10.
The second person goes to city A for a cost of 30.
The third person goes to city B for a cost of 50.
The fourth person goes to city B for a cost of 20.

The total minimum cost is 10 + 30 + 50 + 20 = 110 to have half the people interviewing in each city.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: costs = [[259,770],[448,54],[926,667],[184,139],[840,118],[577,469]]
Output: 1859
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: costs = [[515,563],[451,713],[537,709],[343,819],[855,779],[457,60],[650,359],[631,42]]
Output: 3086
```

**Constraints:**
-   `2 * n == costs.length`
-   `2 <= costs.length <= 100`
-   `costs.length` is even.
-   `1 <= aCosti, bCosti <= 1000`


**Solution:**
- [x] [[Greedy]]

**Intuition** :
How much money can we save if we fly a person to A vs. B? To minimize the total cost, we should fly the person with the maximum saving to A, and with the minimum - to B.

Example: [30, 100], [40, 90], [50, 50], [70, 50].  
Savings: 70, 50, 0, -20.

Obviously, first person should fly to A, and the last - to B.

```
n = length of costs
```
**Time Complexity** : O(n log(n))<br>
**Space Complexity** : O(n)

```java
    public int twoCitySchedCost(int[][] costs) {
        
        PriorityQueue<Node> distance = new PriorityQueue<>();
        for (int[] cost : costs)
            distance.add(new Node(cost[0], cost[1], cost[1] - cost[0]));
        
        int min = 0, count = costs.length / 2;
        for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
            min += distance.remove().cityTwo;
        for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
            min += distance.remove().cityOne;
        
        return min;
    }
    class Node implements Comparable<Node> {
        int cityOne, cityTwo, diff;
        
        public Node(int cityOne, int cityTwo, int diff) {
            this.cityOne = cityOne;
            this.cityTwo = cityTwo;
            this.diff = diff;
        }
        
        @Override
        public int compareTo(Node that) {
            return Integer.compare(this.diff, that.diff);
        }
    }
```
