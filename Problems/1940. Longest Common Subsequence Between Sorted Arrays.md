Given an array of integer arrays `arrays` where each `arrays[i]` is sorted in **strictly increasing** order, return _an integer array representing the **longest common subsequence** between **all** the arrays_.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: arrays = [[1,3,4],
                 [1,4,7,9]]
Output: [1,4]
Explanation: The longest common subsequence in the two arrays is [1,4].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: arrays = [[2,3,6,8],
                 [1,2,3,5,6,7,10],
                 [2,3,4,6,9]]
Output: [2,3,6]
Explanation: The longest common subsequence in all three arrays is [2,3,6].
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: arrays = [[1,2,3,4,5],
                 [6,7,8]]
Output: []
Explanation: There is no common subsequence between the two arrays.
```

**Constraints:**
-   `2 <= arrays.length <= 100`
-   `1 <= arrays[i].length <= 100`
-   `1 <= arrays[i][j] <= 100`
-   `arrays[i]` is sorted in **strictly increasing** order.

**Solution:**
- [x] [[Hash Table]]

**Intuition** :
We do not care about the order (it's already strictly increasing), so we can just count numbers in each array. Numbers that appear `n` times present in all `n` arrays, and therefore should be included into the result.

```
n = length of longest array

**Time Complexity** : O(n)<br>
**Space Complexity** : O(n)

```java
    public List<Integer> longestCommonSubsequence(int[][] arrays) {
        
        int len = arrays.length;
        if (len == 0) return new LinkedList<>();
        
        Set<Integer> common = new HashSet<>();
        for (int num : arrays[0]) common.add(num);
        
        for (int i = 1; i < len; i++) {
            if (common.isEmpty()) break;
            Set<Integer> other = new HashSet<>();
            for (int num : arrays[i]) other.add(num);
            common.retainAll(other);
        }
        return new LinkedList<>(new TreeSet<>(common));
    }
```
