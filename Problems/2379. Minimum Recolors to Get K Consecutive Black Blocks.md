Link: [2379. Minimum Recolors to Get K Consecutive Black Blocks](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-recolors-to-get-k-consecutive-black-blocks/)<br>
Tag : **Easy**<br>
Lock: **Normal**

You are given a **0-indexed** string `blocks` of length `n`, where `blocks[i]` is either `'W'` or `'B'`, representing the color of the `ith` block. The characters `'W'` and `'B'` denote the colors white and black, respectively.

You are also given an integer `k`, which is the desired number of **consecutive** black blocks.

In one operation, you can **recolor** a white block such that it becomes a black block.

Return _the **minimum** number of operations needed such that there is at least **one** occurrence of_ `k` _consecutive black blocks._

**Example 1:**

```
Input: blocks = "WBBWWBBWBW", k = 7
Output: 3
Explanation:
One way to achieve 7 consecutive black blocks is to recolor the 0th, 3rd, and 4th blocks
so that blocks = "BBBBBBBWBW". 
It can be shown that there is no way to achieve 7 consecutive black blocks in less than 3 operations.
Therefore, we return 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: blocks = "WBWBBBW", k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation:
No changes need to be made, since 2 consecutive black blocks already exist.
Therefore, we return 0.
```

**Constraints:**

- `n == blocks.length`
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `blocks[i]` is either `'W'` or `'B'`.
- `1 <= k <= n`

**Solution:**

- [x] [[Sliding Window]]

**Intuition** :

Maintain a window of k , as the window slides over array we will get min in no of coloring is required  

```
n = length of string

**Time Complexity** : O(n)<br>
**Space Complexity** : O(1)

```java
    private char WHITE = 'W';
    private char BLACK = 'B';
    public int minimumRecolors(String blockString, int k) {

        if (blockString == null || 
            blockString.length() < k) return 0;

        char[] blocks = blockString.toCharArray();
        int paintCount = 0,
            start  = 0,
            length = blocks.length,
            minPaintCount = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int end = 0; end < length; end++) {
            if (blocks[end] == WHITE) {
                paintCount++;
            }
            if (end - start + 1 < k) continue;
            
            if (end - start + 1 > k) {
                if (blocks[start] == WHITE) {
                    paintCount--;
                }
                start++;
            }
            minPaintCount = Math.min(minPaintCount, paintCount);
        }
        return minPaintCount;
    }
```
