Link: [1526. Minimum Number of Increments on Subarrays to Form a Target Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-increments-on-subarrays-to-form-a-target-array/) <br>
Tag : **Hard**<br>
Lock: **Normal**

You are given an integer array `target`. You have an integer array `initial` of the same size as `target` with all elements initially zeros.

In one operation you can choose **any** subarray from `initial` and increment each value by one.

Return _the minimum number of operations to form a_ `target` _array from_ `initial`.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: target = [1,2,3,2,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: We need at least 3 operations to form the target array from the initial array.
[0,0,0,0,0] increment 1 from index 0 to 4 (inclusive).
[1,1,1,1,1] increment 1 from index 1 to 3 (inclusive).
[1,2,2,2,1] increment 1 at index 2.
[1,2,3,2,1] target array is formed.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: target = [3,1,1,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: [0,0,0,0] -> [1,1,1,1] -> [1,1,1,2] -> [2,1,1,2] -> [3,1,1,2]
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: target = [3,1,5,4,2]
Output: 7
Explanation: [0,0,0,0,0] -> [1,1,1,1,1] -> [2,1,1,1,1] -> [3,1,1,1,1] -> [3,1,2,2,2] -> [3,1,3,3,2] -> [3,1,4,4,2] -> [3,1,5,4,2].
```

**Constraints:**
-   `1 <= target.length <= 105`
-   `1 <= target[i] <= 105`


**Solution:**

- [x] [[Greedy]]

**Intuition** :
Let us assume that target represents height of columns on a square grid. One operation corresponds to laying out continuous row of bricks. What is the number of these rows? To find this number we count the number of left edges of these rows.

Example: [3,1,5,4,2,3,4,2]. Left edges are marked by red color. Total number of left edges is 3 + 4 + 1 + 1.

```
n = the length of the target array
```
**Time Complexity** : O(n)<br>
**Space Complexity** : O(1)

```java
    public int minNumberOperations(int[] target) {
        
        int len = target.length;
        int minIncrement = target[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < len; i++) {
            minIncrement = minIncrement + Math.max(target[i] - target[i - 1], 0);
        }
        return minIncrement;
    }
```
