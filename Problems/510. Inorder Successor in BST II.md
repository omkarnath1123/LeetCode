Link: [510. Inorder Successor in BST II](https://leetcode.com/problems/inorder-successor-in-bst-ii/) <br>
Tag : **Medium**<br>
Lock: **Premium**

Given a `node` in a binary search tree, return _the in-order successor of that node in the BST_. If that node has no in-order successor, return `null`.

The successor of a `node` is the node with the smallest key greater than `node.val`.

You will have direct access to the node but not to the root of the tree. Each node will have a reference to its parent node. Below is the definition for `Node`:

```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node left;
    public Node right;
    public Node parent;
}
```

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/23/285_example_1.PNG)
```
Input: tree = [2,1,3], node = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: 1's in-order successor node is 2. Note that both the node and the return value is of Node type.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/23/285_example_2.PNG)
```
Input: tree = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], node = 6
Output: null
Explanation: There is no in-order successor of the current node, so the answer is null.
```

**Constraints:**
-   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
-   `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
-   All Nodes will have unique values.

**Follow up:** Could you solve it without looking up any of the node's values?

**Solution:**

- [x] [[Tree]]

**Intuition** :

> Successor = "after node", i.e. the next node in the in-order traversal, or the smallest node _after_ the current one.
> Predecessor = "before node", i.e. the previous node in the in-order traversal, or the largest node _before_ the current one.

There are two possible situations here :
-   Node has a right child, and hence its successor is somewhere lower in the tree. To find the successor, go to the right once and then as many times to the left as you could.

-   Node has no right child, then its successor is somewhere upper in the tree. To find the successor, go up till the node that is _left_ child of its parent. The answer is the parent. Beware that there could be no successor (= null successor) in such a situation.

**Algorithm**
1.  If the node has a right child, and hence its successor is somewhere lower in the tree. Go to the right once and then as many times to the left as you could. Return the node you end up with.
2.  Node has no right child, and hence its successor is somewhere upper in the tree. Go up till the node that is _left_ child of its parent. The answer is the parent.

```
h = the height of the tree
```

```java
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node left;
    public Node right;
    public Node parent;
};
*/

    public Node inorderSuccessor(Node node) {
        
        if (node.right != null) {
            node = node.right;
            while (node.left != null)
                node = node.left;
            return node;
        }
        
        while (node.parent != null && 
               node.parent.right == node)
            node = node.parent;
        return node.parent;
    }
```
