Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return _the number of substrings in_ `s` _of length_ `k` _with no repeated characters_.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "havefunonleetcode", k = 5
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 substrings they are: 'havef','avefu','vefun','efuno','etcod','tcode'.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "home", k = 5
Output: 0
Explanation: Notice k can be larger than the length of s. In this case, it is not possible to find any substring.
```

**Constraints:**
-   `1 <= s.length <= 104`
-   `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
-   `1 <= k <= 104`

**Solution:**

- [x] [[Sliding Window]]

**Intuition** :
1.  Initialize a frequency array of size 26 and two pointers left and right, both initially point to the 0th index.
    
2.  While right is less than nn, where nn is the length of the string, do the following:
    
    i. Add the current character to the frequency array, i.e, increase its frequency by 1 in the array.
    
    ii. If the frequency of the current character in the frequency array is greater than 1, then it is a duplicate character. Increment the left pointer and keep removing elements from the frequency array until the duplicate character has been removed. The window represented by left and right (inclusive) will now only contain unique characters.
    
    iii. If the size of the current window is equal to k, then increment the answer and contract the window by incrementing left and removing the leftmost character from the frequency array. This is done so that the size of the window does not exceed k.
    
    iv. Expand the window by incrementing the right pointer so that the next character can be processed.
    
3.  Once right reaches the end of the string, return the answer.

```
n = the length of the string

```java
    public int numKLenSubstrNoRepeats(String s, int k) {
        if (s == null || s.length() < k) 
            return 0;
        
        Map<Character, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
        
        char[] source = s.toCharArray();
        int len = source.length,
            count = 0,
            start = 0,
            nonUniq = 0;
        for (int end = 0; end < len; end++) {
            char ch = source[end];
            freq.merge(ch, 1, Integer::sum);
            if (freq.get(ch) != 1) nonUniq++;
            
            while (end - start >= k) {
                ch = source[start];
                freq.merge(ch, -1, Integer::sum);
                if (freq.get(ch) > 0) nonUniq--;
                if (freq.get(ch) == 0) freq.remove(ch);
                start++;
            }
            if (end - start + 1 == k && nonUniq == 0)
                count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
