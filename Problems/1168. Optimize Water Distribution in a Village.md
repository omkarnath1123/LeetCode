Tag : **Hard**<br>
Lock: **Premium**

There are `n` houses in a village. We want to supply water for all the houses by building wells and laying pipes.

For each house `i`, we can either build a well inside it directly with cost `wells[i - 1]` (note the `-1` due to **0-indexing**), or pipe in water from another well to it. The costs to lay pipes between houses are given by the array `pipes` where each `pipes[j] = [house1j, house2j, costj]` represents the cost to connect `house1j` and `house2j` together using a pipe. Connections are bidirectional, and there could be multiple valid connections between the same two houses with different costs.

Return _the minimum total cost to supply water to all houses_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/05/22/1359_ex1.png)
```
Input: n = 3, wells = [1,2,2], pipes = [[1,2,1],[2,3,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: The image shows the costs of connecting houses using pipes.
The best strategy is to build a well in the first house with cost 1 and connect the other houses to it with cost 2 so the total cost is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 2, wells = [1,1], pipes = [[1,2,1],[1,2,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: We can supply water with cost two using one of the three options:
Option 1:
  - Build a well inside house 1 with cost 1.
  - Build a well inside house 2 with cost 1.
The total cost will be 2.
Option 2:
  - Build a well inside house 1 with cost 1.
  - Connect house 2 with house 1 with cost 1.
The total cost will be 2.
Option 3:
  - Build a well inside house 2 with cost 1.
  - Connect house 1 with house 2 with cost 1.
The total cost will be 2.
Note that we can connect houses 1 and 2 with cost 1 or with cost 2 but we will always choose the cheapest option. 
```

**Constraints:**
-   `2 <= n <= 104`
-   `wells.length == n`
-   `0 <= wells[i] <= 105`
-   `1 <= pipes.length <= 104`
-   `pipes[j].length == 3`
-   `1 <= house1j, house2j <= n`
-   `0 <= costj <= 105`
-   `house1j != house2j`

## Detailed Intuition

### 💡 How to Think About the Solution

1. **Graph Transformation Concept:**
   - Convert problem into a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
   - Wells can be thought of as edges from a virtual source
   - Each pipe is an edge between houses
   - Total cost = sum of chosen edges

2. **Key Insights:**
   - Add virtual node (node 0) representing water source
   - Connect node 0 to each house with well cost
   - Use Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm for MST
   - Final MST gives optimal water distribution

### 🔍 Edge Cases to Consider
- Only two houses
- No pipes between houses
- Multiple pipes between same houses
- Very expensive wells vs cheap pipes
- Very expensive pipes vs cheap wells
- Maximum number of houses (10^4)
- Maximum cost (10^5)
- Disconnected components
- Cycle in pipe connections

### 🎯 Solution Approaches

1. **Kruskal's Algorithm with UnionFind**
   ```pseudo
   function minCostToSupplyWater(n, wells, pipes):
       edges = []
       # Add virtual edges for wells
       for i in range(n):
           edges.append((wells[i], 0, i+1))
       
       # Add all pipes
       for pipe in pipes:
           edges.append((pipe[2], pipe[0], pipe[1]))
       
       # Sort by cost
       sort edges
       
       uf = UnionFind(n+1)  # +1 for virtual node
       totalCost = 0
       
       for cost, u, v in edges:
           if uf.union(u, v):
               totalCost += cost
       
       return totalCost
   ```
   Time: O(E log E), Space: O(V)
   where E = pipes + n, V = houses + 1

### 📈 Visual Explanation
```
Example: n=3, wells=[1,2,2], pipes=[[1,2,1],[2,3,1]]

1. Transform to Graph:
   Virtual Node (0)
        1┃  2┃  2┃
         ┃   ┃   ┃
    [1]──1──[2]─1──[3]
    
    ┃ = well cost
    ─ = pipe cost

2. MST Selection:
   a) Choose edge (1,2) cost 1
   b) Choose well 1 cost 1
   c) Choose edge (2,3) cost 1
   Total = 3
```

### 🛠️ Implementation Tips
1. Use efficient UnionFind implementation
2. Handle virtual node carefully
3. Sort edges by cost first
4. Track connected components
5. Consider well costs as edges

### 📊 Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(E log E)
  - Sorting edges: O(E log E)
  - UnionFind operations: O(E⋅α(V))
- Space Complexity: O(V + E)
  - UnionFind structure: O(V)
  - Edges array: O(E)

### 📝 Example Processing Flow
```
Input: n=3, wells=[1,2,2], pipes=[[1,2,1],[2,3,1]]

1. Create edges:
   [(1,0,1), (2,0,2), (2,0,3)]  # Well costs
   [(1,1,2), (1,2,3)]           # Pipe costs

2. Sort by cost:
   [(1,0,1), (1,1,2), (1,2,3), (2,0,2), (2,0,3)]

3. Process edges:
   - Use (1,0,1): Cost = 1  [Well at house 1]
   - Use (1,1,2): Cost = 2  [Pipe 1-2]
   - Use (1,2,3): Cost = 3  [Pipe 2-3]

Total Cost = 3
```

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. Forgetting virtual node
2. Not handling multiple pipes
3. Wrong edge cost comparison
4. Inefficient UnionFind
5. Missing disconnected components

```**Solution:**
- [x] [[Union-Find]] 

**Intuition** :
We cannot build any well.  
There is one and only one hidding well in my house (house 0).  
The cost to lay pipe between `house[i]` and my house is `wells[i]`.

In order to supply water to the whole village,  
we need to make the village a connected graph.  
  
**Explanation**

Merge all costs of pipes together and sort by key.  
Greedily lay the pipes if it can connect two separate union.  
Apply union find to record which houses are connected.
