Link: [285. Inorder Successor in BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/inorder-successor-in-bst/) <br>
Tag : **Medium**<br>
Lock: **Premium**

Given the `root` of a binary search tree and a node `p` in it, return _the in-order successor of that node in the BST_. If the given node has no in-order successor in the tree, return `null`.

The successor of a node `p` is the node with the smallest key greater than `p.val`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/23/285_example_1.PNG)
```
Input: root = [2,1,3], p = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: 1's in-order successor node is 2. Note that both p and the return value is of TreeNode type.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/23/285_example_2.PNG)
```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], p = 6
Output: null
Explanation: There is no in-order successor of the current node, so the answer is null.
```

**Constraints:**
-   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
-   `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
-   All Nodes will have unique values.

**Solution:**

- [x] [[Depth First Search]]

**Intuition** :
traverse the tree in in-order fashion and store the successor while traversing. 

```
n = no. of nodes in the tree
```
**Time Complexity** : O(n)<br>
**Space Complexity** : O(1)

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
 
    boolean pickNext;
    TreeNode successor;
    public TreeNode inorderSuccessor(TreeNode root, TreeNode target) {
        pickNext = false;
        successor = null;
        traverse(root, target);
        return successor;
    }
    private void traverse(TreeNode node, TreeNode target) {
        if (node == null) return;
        if (successor != null) return;
        
        traverse(node.left, target);
        if (pickNext && successor == null) successor = node;
        if (target == node) pickNext = true;
        traverse(node.right, target);
    }
```
