Link: [2462. Total Cost to Hire K Workers](https://leetcode.com/problems/total-cost-to-hire-k-workers/description/) <br>
Tag : **Medium**<br>
Lock: **Normal**

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `costs` where `costs[i]` is the cost of hiring the `ith` worker.

You are also given two integers `k` and `candidates`. We want to hire exactly `k` workers according to the following rules:

- You will run `k` sessions and hire exactly one worker in each session.
- In each hiring session, choose the worker with the lowest cost from either the first `candidates` workers or the last `candidates` workers. Break the tie by the smallest index.
    - For example, if `costs = [3,2,7,7,1,2]` and `candidates = 2`, then in the first hiring session, we will choose the `4th` worker because they have the lowest cost `[3,2,7,7,**1**,2]`.
    - In the second hiring session, we will choose `1st` worker because they have the same lowest cost as `4th` worker but they have the smallest index `[3,**2**,7,7,2]`. Please note that the indexing may be changed in the process.
- If there are fewer than candidates workers remaining, choose the worker with the lowest cost among them. Break the tie by the smallest index.
- A worker can only be chosen once.

Return _the total cost to hire exactly_ `k` _workers._

**Example 1:**

```
Input: costs = [17,12,10,2,7,2,11,20,8], k = 3, candidates = 4
Output: 11
Explanation: We hire 3 workers in total. The total cost is initially 0.
- In the first hiring round we choose the worker from [17,12,10,2,7,2,11,20,8]. The lowest cost is 2, and we break the tie by the smallest index, which is 3. The total cost = 0 + 2 = 2.
- In the second hiring round we choose the worker from [17,12,10,7,2,11,20,8]. The lowest cost is 2 (index 4). The total cost = 2 + 2 = 4.
- In the third hiring round we choose the worker from [17,12,10,7,11,20,8]. The lowest cost is 7 (index 3). The total cost = 4 + 7 = 11. Notice that the worker with index 3 was common in the first and last four workers.
The total hiring cost is 11.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: costs = [1,2,4,1], k = 3, candidates = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: We hire 3 workers in total. The total cost is initially 0.
- In the first hiring round we choose the worker from [1,2,4,1]. The lowest cost is 1, and we break the tie by the smallest index, which is 0. The total cost = 0 + 1 = 1. Notice that workers with index 1 and 2 are common in the first and last 3 workers.
- In the second hiring round we choose the worker from [2,4,1]. The lowest cost is 1 (index 2). The total cost = 1 + 1 = 2.
- In the third hiring round there are less than three candidates. We choose the worker from the remaining workers [2,4]. The lowest cost is 2 (index 0). The total cost = 2 + 2 = 4.
The total hiring cost is 4.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= costs.length <= 105`
- `1 <= costs[i] <= 105`
- `1 <= k, candidates <= costs.length`

**Solution:**

- [x] [[Heap]] + [[Two Pointer]]

## Detailed Intuition

1. Two integer variables `i` and `j` are initialized to track the start and end indices of the `costs` vector, respectively. These indices will be used to iterate over the vector.
2. Two priority queues, `pq1` and `pq2`, are created. Priority queues are data structures that allow efficient insertion and retrieval of elements while maintaining a specific order. In this case, the elements are integers, and the order is ascending (`greater<int>`).
3. A `long long` variable `ans` is initialized to store the total cost.
4. The code enters a loop that executes `k` times, where `k` is the number of workers to be hired.
5. Inside the loop, two nested `while` loops are used to populate `pq1` and `pq2` with candidates from the `costs` vector. The conditions for these loops are as follows:
    - `pq1` should contain at most `candidates` elements, and `i` should be less than or equal to `j`.
    - `pq2` should also contain at most `candidates` elements, and `i` should be less than or equal to `j`.  
        These loops essentially fill the priority queues with the smallest `candidates` elements from the `costs` vector, taking elements from both ends of the vector (`i` and `j`).
6. After the `while` loops, the code compares the top elements (`t1` and `t2`) of `pq1` and `pq2` to determine which one is smaller. If both queues are empty, `INT_MAX` (maximum value for an `int`) is used as a placeholder.
7. If `t1` is smaller than or equal to `t2`, the cost of the worker represented by `t1` is added to `ans`, and the top element is removed from `pq1` using `pq1.pop()`. Otherwise, the cost of the worker represented by `t2` is added to `ans`, and the top element is removed from `pq2` using `pq2.pop()`.
8. The loop continues until `k` workers have been hired.
9. Finally, the function returns the accumulated total cost (`ans`).

**Space Complexity** : O(n*log(n))

    public long totalCost(int[] costs, int k, int candidates) {
        
        int len = costs.length;
        PriorityQueue<Index> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();

        long cost = 0;
        if (2 * candidates >= len) {
            for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) minHeap.add(new Index(i, costs[i]));
            for (;k != 0; k--) cost = cost + minHeap.remove().val;
        } else {
            int start = 0, end = len - 1;
            for (; start < candidates; start++) minHeap.add(new Index(start, costs[start]));
            for (; end >= len - candidates; end--) minHeap.add(new Index(end, costs[end]));
            start--;
            end++;

            while (k > 0 && start + 1 < end) {
                Index remove = minHeap.remove();
                cost = cost + remove.val;

                if (remove.index <= start) {
                    start++;

                    minHeap.add(new Index(end, costs[end]));
                }
                k--;
            }

            for (; k != 0; k--) cost = cost + minHeap.remove().val;
