Tag : **Medium**<br>
Lock: **Premium**

Given a `root` of an N-ary tree, return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) (clone) of the tree.

Each node in the n-ary tree contains a val (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its children.

```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> children;
}
```

_Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples)._

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/narytreeexample.png)
```
Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
Output: [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/08/sample_4_964.png)
```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]
Output: [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]
```

**Constraints:**
-   The depth of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to `1000`.
-   The total number of nodes is between `[0, 104]`.

**Follow up:** Can your solution work for the [graph problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/)?

**Solution:**
- [x] [[Depth First Search]]

**Intuition** :
We can consider the above recursive solution as a DFS approach where we traverse the nodes in a tree in a manner that prioritizes the depth.
As an alternative to implement the DFS approach, we can also implement it in an **_iterative_** manner.

> The key idea is to simulate the function call stack with an actual **_stack_** data structure.

The stack data structure mainly serves two purposes:
-   Maintaining the order of DFS visits.
-   Keeping the context information for each visit.

For more details concerning the algorithm of DFS, one can refer to our Explore Card named [Queue & Stack](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/queue-stack/232/practical-application-stack/).

**Algorithm**

To implement the DFS approach with iteration, here are a few steps:

-   First, we create an empty stack, _e.g._ in Python we can simply use the `List` data structure.
-   Each element in the stack will be a pair of nodes `(old, new)`, _i.e._ one is the original node to copy and the other one is the newly-created clone.
-   We then build a loop around the stack. At each iteration, we pop one element `(old, new)` out of the stack. Then for each child node from the original node, we make a clone and append the child node along with the clone into the stack.
-   The loop will terminate when there are no more elements in the stack, which means that we have traversed all the nodes in the tree.

```
n = be the number of nodes in the input tree

**Time Complexity** : O(n)<br>
**Space Complexity** : O(log<sub>m</sub> n)

```java
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> children;

    
    public Node() {
        children = new ArrayList<Node>();
    }
    
    public Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
        children = new ArrayList<Node>();
    }
    
    public Node(int _val,ArrayList<Node> _children) {
        val = _val;
        children = _children;
    }
};
*/
    public Node cloneTree(Node root) {
        if (root == null) return null;
        
        Node clone = new Node(root.val);
        return clone(root, clone);
    }
    private Node clone(Node node, Node clone) {
        if (node == null) return null;
        
        clone.children = new LinkedList<>();
        for (Node child : node.children)
            clone.children.add(clone(child, new Node(child.val)));
        return clone;
    }
```
