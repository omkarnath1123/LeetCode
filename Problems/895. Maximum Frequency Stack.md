Tag : **Hard**<br>
Lock: **Normal**

Design a stack-like data structure to push elements to the stack and pop the most frequent element from the stack.

Implement the `FreqStack` class:

-   `FreqStack()` constructs an empty frequency stack.
-   `void push(int val)` pushes an integer `val` onto the top of the stack.
-   `int pop()` removes and returns the most frequent element in the stack.
    -   If there is a tie for the most frequent element, the element closest to the stack's top is removed and returned.

**Example 1:**
```
Input
["FreqStack", "push", "push", "push", "push", "push", "push", "pop", "pop", "pop", "pop"]
[[], [5], [7], [5], [7], [4], [5], [], [], [], []]
Output
[null, null, null, null, null, null, null, 5, 7, 5, 4]

Explanation
FreqStack freqStack = new FreqStack();
freqStack.push(5); // The stack is [5]
freqStack.push(7); // The stack is [5,7]
freqStack.push(5); // The stack is [5,7,5]
freqStack.push(7); // The stack is [5,7,5,7]
freqStack.push(4); // The stack is [5,7,5,7,4]
freqStack.push(5); // The stack is [5,7,5,7,4,5]
freqStack.pop();   // return 5, as 5 is the most frequent. The stack becomes [5,7,5,7,4].
freqStack.pop();   // return 7, as 5 and 7 is the most frequent, but 7 is closest to the top. The stack becomes [5,7,5,4].
freqStack.pop();   // return 5, as 5 is the most frequent. The stack becomes [5,7,4].
freqStack.pop();   // return 4, as 4, 5 and 7 is the most frequent, but 4 is closest to the top. The stack becomes [5,7].
```

**Constraints:**
-   `0 <= val <= 109`
-   At most `2 * 104` calls will be made to `push` and `pop`.
-   It is guaranteed that there will be at least one element in the stack before calling `pop`.

**Solution:**

- [x] [[Hash Table]] + [[Stack]]

**Intuition** :
Evidently, we care about the frequency of an element. Let `freq` be a `Map` from xx to the number of occurrences of xx.
Also, we (probably) care about `maxfreq`, the current maximum frequency of any element in the stack. This is clear because we must pop the element with the maximum frequency.
The main question then becomes: among elements with the same (maximum) frequency, how do we know which element is most recent? We can use a stack to query this information: the top of the stack is the most recent.
To this end, let `group` be a map from frequency to a stack of elements with that frequency. We now have all the required components to implement `FreqStack`.

**Algorithm**
Actually, as an implementation level detail, if `x` has frequency `f`, then we'll have `x` in all `group[i] (i <= f)`, not just the top. This is because each `group[i]` will store information related to the `i`th copy of `x`.
Afterwards, our goal is just to maintain `freq`, `group`, and `maxfreq` as described above.

```
n = is no.of elements in stack
```
**Time Complexity** : O(1) for each query <br>
**Space Complexity** : O(n)

```java
class FreqStack {

    Map<Integer, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
    Map<Integer, Deque<Integer>> group = new HashMap<>();
    int maxFreq = 0;
    public FreqStack() {
        
    }
    
    public void push(int val) {
        freq.merge(val, 1, Integer::sum);
        int count = freq.get(val);
        group.computeIfAbsent(count, item -> new LinkedList<>()).offerLast(val);
        maxFreq = Math.max(maxFreq, count);
    }
    
    public int pop() {
        int pop = group.get(maxFreq).pollLast();
        freq.merge(pop, -1, Integer::sum);
        if (freq.get(pop) == 0) freq.remove(pop);
        if (group.get(maxFreq).isEmpty()) maxFreq--;
        return pop;
    }
}

/**
 * Your FreqStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * FreqStack obj = new FreqStack();
 * obj.push(val);
 * int param_2 = obj.pop();
 */
```
