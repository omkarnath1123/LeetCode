A set of real numbers can be represented as the union of several disjoint intervals, where each interval is in the form `[a, b)`. A real number `x` is in the set if one of its intervals `[a, b)` contains `x` (i.e. `a <= x < b`).

You are given a **sorted** list of disjoint intervals `intervals` representing a set of real numbers as described above, where `intervals[i] = [ai, bi]` represents the interval `[ai, bi)`. You are also given another interval `toBeRemoved`.

Return _the set of real numbers with the interval_ `toBeRemoved` _**removed** from_ `intervals`_. In other words, return the set of real numbers such that every_ `x` _in the set is in_ `intervals` _but **not** in_ `toBeRemoved`_. Your answer should be a **sorted** list of disjoint intervals as described above._

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/24/removeintervalex1.png)
```
Input: intervals = [[0,2],[3,4],[5,7]], toBeRemoved = [1,6]
Output: [[0,1],[6,7]]
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/24/removeintervalex2.png)
```
Input: intervals = [[0,5]], toBeRemoved = [2,3]
Output: [[0,2],[3,5]]
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: intervals = [[-5,-4],[-3,-2],[1,2],[3,5],[8,9]], toBeRemoved = [-1,4]
Output: [[-5,-4],[-3,-2],[4,5],[8,9]]
```

**Constraints:**
-   `1 <= intervals.length <= 104`
-   `-109 <= ai < bi <= 109`

**Solution:**

- [x] [[Array]]

**Intuition** :

> What is the best possible time complexity here?

**Sweep Line**

[Sweep Line algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweep_line_algorithm) is a sort of geometrical visualisation. Let's imagine a vertical line which is swept across the plane, stopping at some points. That could create various situations, and the decision to make depends on the stop point.

![line](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-interval/Figures/1272/sweep2.png)

**Algorithm**

Let's sweep the line by iterating over input intervals and consider what it could bring to us.
-   Current interval has no overlaps with toBeRemoved one. That means there is nothing to take care about, just update the output.

![line](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-interval/Figures/1272/no_overlaps.png)

-   Second situation is when toBeRemoved interval is inside of the current interval. Then one has to add two non-overlapping parts of the current interval in the output.

![line](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-interval/Figures/1272/inside2.png)

-   "Left" overlap.

![line](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-interval/Figures/1272/left_overlap.png)

-   "Right" overlap.

![line](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-interval/Figures/1272/right_overlap.png)

And here we are, all situations are covered, the job is done.

**Implementation**
One way of converting the above into code would be to check for each of the four situations described above. A better way though is to recognize that _if there is any overlap_, then the overlapped interval will be broken into _up to two new intervals_; a left interval and a right interval. We can, therefore, treat situation 2 as being both situation 3 and situation 4.

            if (interval[1] < toBeRemoved[0] || 
                interval[0] > toBeRemoved[1])
                remains.add(Arrays.asList(interval[0], interval[1]));

                else if (interval[0] < toBeRemoved[0] && 
                         interval[1] > toBeRemoved[1]) {
                    remains.add(Arrays.asList(interval[0], toBeRemoved[0]));
                    remains.add(Arrays.asList(toBeRemoved[1], interval[1]));
                } else {
                    if (interval[0] < toBeRemoved[0])
                        remains.add(Arrays.asList(interval[0], toBeRemoved[0]));
                    else if (toBeRemoved[1] < interval[1])
                        remains.add(Arrays.asList(toBeRemoved[1], interval[1]));
                }
