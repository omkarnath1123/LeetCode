Tag : **Hard**<br>
Lock: **Normal**

There are `n` children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array `ratings`.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

-   Each child must have at least one candy.
-   Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return _the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children_.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
```

**Constraints:**
-   `n == ratings.length`
-   `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`
-   `0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 104`


**Solution:**

- [x] [[Greedy]]

**Intuition** :
1.  Do it in two directions.
2.  The first loop makes sure children with a higher rating get more candy than its **left** neighbor; the second loop makes sure children with a higher rating get more candy than its **right** neighbor.


```
n = the no. ratings
```
**Time Complexity** : O(n)<br>
**Space Complexity** : O(n)

```java
    public int candy(int[] ratings) {
        
        int sum = 0,
            len = ratings.length;
        int[] leftToRight = new int[len],
              rightToLeft = new int[len];
        Arrays.fill(leftToRight, 1);
        Arrays.fill(rightToLeft, 1);
        
        for (int i = 1; i < len; i++)
            if (ratings[i - 1] < ratings[i])
                leftToRight[i] = leftToRight[i - 1] + 1;
        
        for (int i = len - 1; i > 0; i--)
            if (ratings[i - 1] > ratings[i])
                rightToLeft[i - 1] = rightToLeft[i] + 1;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++)
            sum = sum + Math.max(leftToRight[i], rightToLeft[i]);
        
        return sum;
    }
```
