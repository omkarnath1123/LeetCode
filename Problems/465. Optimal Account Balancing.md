You are given an array of transactions `transactions` where `transactions[i] = [fromi, toi, amounti]` indicates that the person with `ID = fromi` gave `amounti $` to the person with `ID = toi`.

Return _the minimum number of transactions required to settle the debt_.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: transactions = [[0,1,10],[2,0,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation:
Person #0 gave person #1 $10.
Person #2 gave person #0 $5.
Two transactions are needed. One way to settle the debt is person #1 pays person #0 and #2 $5 each.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: transactions = [[0,1,10],[1,0,1],[1,2,5],[2,0,5]]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Person #0 gave person #1 $10.
Person #1 gave person #0 $1.
Person #1 gave person #2 $5.
Person #2 gave person #0 $5.
Therefore, person #1 only need to give person #0 $4, and all debt is settled.
```

**Constraints:**
-   `1 <= transactions.length <= 8`
-   `transactions[i].length == 3`
-   `0 <= fromi, toi < 12`
-   `fromi != toi`
-   `1 <= amounti <= 100`

**Solution:**
- [x] [[Backtracking]]

**Intuition** :
With all the given transactions, in the end, each person with ID = `id` will have an overall balance `bal[id]`. Note that the `id` value or any person coincidentally with `0` balance is irrelevant to debt settling count, so we can simply use an array `debt[]` to store all non-zero balances, where

-   `debt[i] > 0` means a person needs to pay `$ debt[i]` to other person(s);
-   `debt[i] < 0` means a person needs to collect `$ debt[i]` back from other person(s).

Starting from first debt `debt[0]`, we look for all other debts `debt[i]` (`i>0`) which have opposite sign to `debt[0]`. Then each such `debt[i]` can make one transaction `debt[i] += debt[0]` to clear the person with debt `debt[0]`. From now on, the person with debt `debt[0]` is dropped out of the problem and we recursively drop persons one by one until everyone's debt is cleared meanwhile updating the minimum number of transactions during DFS.

```java
    int minTransaction = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    public int minTransfers(int[][] transactions) {
        
        Map<Integer, Integer> amounts = new HashMap<>();
        for (int[] transaction : transactions) {
            amounts.merge(transaction[0], transaction[2], Integer::sum);
            amounts.merge(transaction[1], -transaction[2], Integer::sum);
        }
        List<Integer> balances = new LinkedList<>();
        for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : amounts.entrySet())
            balances.add(entry.getValue());
        
        backTrack(0, balances, 0);
        return minTransaction;
    }
    private void backTrack(int index, List<Integer> balance, int transactionCount) {
        int len = balance.size();
        while (index < len && balance.get(index) == 0)
            index++;
        
        if (index == len) {
            minTransaction = Math.min(minTransaction, transactionCount);
        } else {
             boolean isPos = balance.get(index) > 0;
            for (int i = index + 1; i < len; i++) {
                boolean isNeg = balance.get(i) < 0;
                if (isPos == isNeg) {
                    balance.set(i, balance.get(i) + balance.get(index));
                    backTrack(index + 1, balance, transactionCount + 1);
                    balance.set(i, balance.get(i) - balance.get(index));
                }
            }
        }
    }
```
