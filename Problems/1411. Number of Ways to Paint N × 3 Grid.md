Link: [1411. Number of Ways to Paint N × 3 Grid](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-paint-n-3-grid/) <br>
Tag : **Hard**<br>
Lock: **Normal**

You have a `grid` of size `n x 3` and you want to paint each cell of the grid with exactly one of the three colors: **Red**, **Yellow,** or **Green** while making sure that no two adjacent cells have the same color (i.e., no two cells that share vertical or horizontal sides have the same color).

Given `n` the number of rows of the grid, return _the number of ways_ you can paint this `grid`. As the answer may grow large, the answer **must be** computed modulo `109 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 1
Output: 12
Explanation: There are 12 possible way to paint the grid as shown.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 5000
Output: 30228214
```

**Constraints:**
-   `n == grid.length`
-   `1 <= n <= 5000`

**Intuition** :

1.  There are only two possibilities to form a non-adjacent row: **3 colors combination** (use all three colors, e.g., RYG) and **2 color combination** (use only two of three colors, e.g., RYR).
2.  We add the new row one by one. Apart from its inner adjacent relation, **every new added row only relies on the previous one row** (new added row is only adjacent with the row above it).
3.  **Every color combination follows the same pattern indicated below**. 3-color combination can generate **two** 3-color combination, and **two** 2-color combination for the next round. 2-color combination can generate **two** 3-color combination, and **three** 2-color combination for the next round.

Let's try to have a math eqution to show the change above.  
The number of 3-color combination for round n is: **S(n)**. The number of 2-color combination for round n is **T(n**).  
Thus, we can have two simple math equations reflecting the relation between current round (n) with next round (n + 1) for both 3-color-combination and 2-color-combination.

**S(n + 1) = 2 * S(n) + 2 * T(n)**  
**T(n + 1) = 2 * S(n) + 3 * T(n)**

```
n = length of the grid

**Time Complexity** : O(n)<br>
**Space Complexity** : O(n)

```java
    public int numOfWays(int n) {
        
        int mod = (int)Math.pow(10, 9) + 7;
        long[] pickTwoColor = new long[n];
        long[] pickThreeColor = new long[n];
        pickTwoColor[0] = 6;
        pickThreeColor[0] = 6;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            pickTwoColor[i + 1] = 
                (2 * pickTwoColor[i] + 2 * pickThreeColor[i]) % mod;
            pickThreeColor[i + 1] = 
                (2 * pickTwoColor[i] + 3 * pickThreeColor[i]) % mod; 
        }
        return (int)((pickTwoColor[n - 1] + pickThreeColor[n - 1]) % mod);
    }
```
