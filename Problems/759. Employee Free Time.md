We are given a list `schedule` of employees, which represents the working time for each employee.

Each employee has a list of non-overlapping `Intervals`, and these intervals are in sorted order.

Return the list of finite intervals representing **common, positive-length free time** for _all_ employees, also in sorted order.

(Even though we are representing `Intervals` in the form `[x, y]`, the objects inside are `Intervals`, not lists or arrays. For example, `schedule[0][0].start = 1`, `schedule[0][0].end = 2`, and `schedule[0][0][0]` is not defined).  Also, we wouldn't include intervals like [5, 5] in our answer, as they have zero length.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: schedule = [[[1,2],[5,6]],[[1,3]],[[4,10]]]
Output: [[3,4]]
Explanation: There are a total of three employees, and all common
free time intervals would be [-inf, 1], [3, 4], [10, inf].
We discard any intervals that contain inf as they aren't finite.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: schedule = [[[1,3],[6,7]],[[2,4]],[[2,5],[9,12]]]
Output: [[5,6],[7,9]]
```

**Constraints:**
-   `1 <= schedule.length , schedule[i].length <= 50`
-   `0 <= schedule[i].start < schedule[i].end <= 10^8`

**Solution:**
- [x] [[Heap]]

**Intuition** :
The idea is to just add all the intervals to the priority queue. (NOTE that it is not matter how many different people are there for the algorithm. because we just need to find a gap in the time line.

1.  priority queue - sorted by start time, and for same start time sort by either largest end time or smallest (it is not matter).
2.  Every-time you poll from priority queue, just make sure it doesn't intersect with previous interval.  
    This mean that there is no common interval. Everyone is free time.

```
n = is the number of intervals

**Time Complexity** : O(n* log(n))<br>
**Space Complexity** : O(n)
