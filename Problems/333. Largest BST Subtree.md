Given the root of a binary tree, find the largest subtree, which is also a Binary Search Tree (BST), where the largest means subtree has the largest number of nodes.

A **Binary Search Tree (BST)** is a tree in which all the nodes follow the below-mentioned properties:

-   The left subtree values are less than the value of their parent (root) node's value.
-   The right subtree values are greater than the value of their parent (root) node's value.

**Note:** A subtree must include all of its descendants.

**Example 1:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/17/tmp.jpg)**
```
Input: root = [10,5,15,1,8,null,7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The Largest BST Subtree in this case is the highlighted one. The return value is the subtree's size, which is 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: root = [4,2,7,2,3,5,null,2,null,null,null,null,null,1]
Output: 2
```

**Constraints:**
-   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.
-   `-104 <= Node.val <= 104`

**Follow up:** Can you figure out ways to solve it with `O(n)` time complexity?


**Solution:**

- [x] [[Depth First Search]]

**Intuition** :

1.  Traverse each node of the given tree in a post-order manner.  
    That is, visit the left child, then the right child, and then the root node.
2.  For each node, perform the following checks to determine if the subtree rooted at the current node is a BST:
    -   Current node's value should be smaller than minimum node value of right subtree.
    -   Current node's value should be greater than maximum node value of left subtree.
3.  If the tree rooted at the current node is BST:
    -   Calculate the size of the current subtree by adding 1 (for the current node) to the size of the left subtree plus the size of the right subtree.
4.  Otherwise, if the current node is not a BST, return max BST size in left or right subtree of the current node.

```
n = the no. of nodes in tree
h = height of the tree
