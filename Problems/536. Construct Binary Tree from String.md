You need to construct a binary tree from a string consisting of parenthesis and integers.

The whole input represents a binary tree. It contains an integer followed by zero, one or two pairs of parenthesis. The integer represents the root's value and a pair of parenthesis contains a child binary tree with the same structure.

You always start to construct the **left** child node of the parent first if it exists.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "4(2(3)(1))(6(5))"
Output: [4,2,6,3,1,5]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "4(2(3)(1))(6(5)(7))"
Output: [4,2,6,3,1,5,7]
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "-4(2(3)(1))(6(5)(7))"
Output: [-4,2,6,3,1,5,7]
```

**Constraints:**
-   `0 <= s.length <= 3 * 104`
-   `s` consists of digits, `'('`, `')'`, and `'-'` only.

**Solution:**
- [x] [[Depth First Search]]

**Intuition** :

**Algorithm**
1.  Let's define a couple of internal functions that we will be using along the way. The first one is called `getNumber` and it returns the integer number/value that the current `TreeNode` is supposed to have. It takes the string and the current index as inputs. We iterate until we no longer encounter a digit or we reach the end of the string. We stick all the digits together and get a number. Also, we take care of the sign `-` in case one exists in the beginning which would indicate a negative value for the node.
2.  The next function we define is our recursive function called `str2treeInternal` which does all the heavy lifting for us. It also takes the string and the index of the current character as inputs and returns a pair of the `TreeNode` representation of the current subtree and also the index of the next character to be processed in the string. This index manipulation is important because we don't want to parse the string twice to figure out the boundaries for the children subtrees.
3.  Whenever the function `str2treeInternal` is called, we expect that the current subtree will all its children and descendants will be constructed and returned. There are 4 steps we take inside this function of ours.
    1.  Firstly we check for the termination condition i.e. if there are no more characters left in the string to process.

        _Figure 3. Sample subtrees which we will consider for the algorithm._
        
    2.  Next, we get the value for the root node of this tree. This is an invariant here. We will never find any brackets before we get the value for the root node.
        
        ![](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-string/Figures/536/img4.png)
        
    3.  Once we have the value, we form the root node.
    4.  Then, we check for an opening bracket (make sure to check for the end of string conditions always). If there is one, we make a recursive call and use the node returned as the left child of the current node.
        
        ![](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-string/Figures/536/img5.png)
        
    5.  Finally, we check if there's another opening bracket. If there is one, then it represents our right child and we again make a recursive call to construct that and make the right connection.
        
        ![](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-string/Figures/536/img6.png)
        
4.  We return the construct root node and also the correct index. For the index, we check if it points to a closing bracket, we move one step forward. Else, we stay at the current spot and let the caller function decide how to proceed/process.
