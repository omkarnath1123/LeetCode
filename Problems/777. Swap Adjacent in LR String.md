Link: [777. Swap Adjacent in LR String](https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-adjacent-in-lr-string/) <br>
Tag : **Medium**<br>
Lock: **Normal**

In a string composed of `'L'`, `'R'`, and `'X'` characters, like `"RXXLRXRXL"`, a move consists of either replacing one occurrence of `"XL"` with `"LX"`, or replacing one occurrence of `"RX"` with `"XR"`. Given the starting string `start` and the ending string `end`, return `True` if and only if there exists a sequence of moves to transform one string to the other.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: start = "RXXLRXRXL", end = "XRLXXRRLX"
Output: true
Explanation: We can transform start to end following these steps:
RXXLRXRXL ->
XRXLRXRXL ->
XRLXRXRXL ->
XRLXXRRXL ->
XRLXXRRLX
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: start = "X", end = "L"
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**
-   `1 <= start.length <= 104`
-   `start.length == end.length`
-   Both `start` and `end` will only consist of characters in `'L'`, `'R'`, and `'X'`.

**Solution:**

- [x] [[Two Pointer]]

**Intuition** :
**Key observations:**

There are three kinds of characters, ‘L’, ‘R’, ‘X’.  
Replacing XL with LX = move L to the left by one  
Replacing RX with XR = move R to the right by one  
If we remove all the X in both strings, the resulting strings should be the same.

**Additional observations:**

Since a move always involves X, an L or R cannot move through another L or R.  
Since an L can only move to the right, for each occurrence of L in the start string, its position should be to the same or to the left of its corresponding L in the end string.

And vice versa for the R characters.

**Implementation**

We first compare two strings with X removed. This checks relative position between Ls and Rs are correct.
Then we find the indices for each occurence of L and check the condition in the above figure. Then we do the same for R.

```
n = no. of characters in the string

```java
    public boolean canTransform(String start, String end) {
        if (!start.replaceAll("X", "").equals(end.replaceAll("X", "")))
            return false;
        
        int one = 0, 
            two = 0,
            len = start.length();
        while (one <= len && two <= len) {
            
            while (one < len && start.charAt(one) == 'X')
                one++;
            while (two < len && end.charAt(two) == 'X')
                two++;
            
            if (one == len && two == len) return true;
            if (one == len || two == len) return false;
            char chOne = start.charAt(one),
                 chTwo = end.charAt(two);
            if (chOne != chTwo)
                return false;
            
            if (chOne == 'L' && two > one) return false;
            if (chOne == 'R' && one > two) return false;
            one++;
            two++;
        }
        return true;
    }
```
