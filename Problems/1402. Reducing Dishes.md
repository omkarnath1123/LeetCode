Lock: **Normal**

A chef has collected data on the `satisfaction` level of his `n` dishes. Chef can cook any dish in 1 unit of time.

**Like-time coefficient** of a dish is defined as the time taken to cook that dish including previous dishes multiplied by its satisfaction level i.e. `time[i] * satisfaction[i]`.

Return _the maximum sum of **like-time coefficient** that the chef can obtain after dishes preparation_.

Dishes can be prepared in **any** order and the chef can discard some dishes to get this maximum value.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: satisfaction = [-1,-8,0,5,-9]
Output: 14
Explanation: After Removing the second and last dish, the maximum total like-time coefficient will be equal to (-1*1 + 0*2 + 5*3 = 14).
Each dish is prepared in one unit of time.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: satisfaction = [4,3,2]
Output: 20
Explanation: Dishes can be prepared in any order, (2*1 + 3*2 + 4*3 = 20)
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: satisfaction = [-1,-4,-5]
Output: 0
Explanation: People do not like the dishes. No dish is prepared.
```

**Constraints:**
-   `n == satisfaction.length`
-   `1 <= n <= 500`
-   `-1000 <= satisfaction[i] <= 1000`

**Solution:**
- [x] [[Greedy]] 

**Intuition** :

If we cook some dishes,  
they must be the most satisfied among all choices.

Another important observation is that,  
we will cook the dish with small satisfication,  
and leave the most satisfied dish in the end.

**Explanation**

We choose dishes from most satisfied.  
Everytime we add a new dish to the menu list,  
all dishes on the menu list will be cooked one time unit later,  
so the `result += total satisfaction on the list`.  
We'll keep doing this as long as `A[i] + total > 0`.

```
n == the no of dishes
```
**Time Complexity** : O(n log(n))<br>
**Space Complexity** : O(1)

```java
    public int maxSatisfaction(int[] satisfaction) {
        
        Arrays.sort(satisfaction);
        int len = satisfaction.length;
        int sum = 0,
            start = len;
        
        for (int i = len - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            sum = sum + satisfaction[i];
            if (sum <= 0) {
                break;
            }
            start = i;
        }
        
        int time = 1,
            likeness = 0;
        for (int i = start; i < len; i++) {
            likeness = likeness + time * satisfaction[i];
            time++;
        }
        return likeness;
    }
```
