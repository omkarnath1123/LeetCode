Link: [1388. Pizza With 3n Slices](https://leetcode.com/problems/pizza-with-3n-slices/) <br>
Tag : **Hard**<br>
Lock: **Normal**

There is a pizza with `3n` slices of varying size, you and your friends will take slices of pizza as follows:

-   You will pick **any** pizza slice.
-   Your friend Alice will pick the next slice in the anti-clockwise direction of your pick.
-   Your friend Bob will pick the next slice in the clockwise direction of your pick.
-   Repeat until there are no more slices of pizzas.

Given an integer array `slices` that represent the sizes of the pizza slices in a clockwise direction, return _the maximum possible sum of slice sizes that you can pick_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: slices = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 10
Explanation: Pick pizza slice of size 4, Alice and Bob will pick slices with size 3 and 5 respectively. Then Pick slices with size 6, finally Alice and Bob will pick slice of size 2 and 1 respectively. Total = 4 + 6.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/18/sample_4_1723.png)

```
Input: slices = [8,9,8,6,1,1]
Output: 16
Explanation: Pick pizza slice of size 8 in each turn. If you pick slice with size 9 your partners will pick slices of size 8.
```

**Constraints:**
-   `3 * n == slices.length`
-   `1 <= slices.length <= 500`
-   `1 <= slices[i] <= 1000`


**Solution:**

- [x] [[Dynamic Programming]] + [[Top-Down Solution]]

**Intuition** :
-   We can understand the problem: pick `n` **non-adjacent** elements from **circular array** `m=3n` elements so that the sum of the elements is maximum.
-   We can't pick `0th` and `(m-1)th` elements at the same time, since it's adjacent in circular array.
-   So there are total 2 cases, then we can return the case with maximum sum:
    -   Case 1: Don't pick `(m-1)th` element  
        => Solve problem: pick `n` **non-adjacent** elements from **linear array** elements in ranges `[0..m-2]` so that the sum of the elements is maximum.
    -   Case 2: Don't pick `0th` element  
        => Solve problem: pick `n` **non-adjacent** elements from **linear array** elements in ranges `[1..m-1]` so that the sum of the elements is maximum.

n = is the number of slices in pizza need to pick

```java
    public int maxSizeSlices(int[] slices) {
        int count = slices.length,
            canPick = count / 3;
        int[] ignoreFirst = Arrays.copyOfRange(slices, 1, count);
        int[] ignoreLast = Arrays.copyOfRange(slices, 0, count - 1);
        return Math.max(getMaxSlices(ignoreFirst, canPick), getMaxSlices(ignoreLast, canPick));
    }
    private int getMaxSlices(int[] slices, int canPick) {
        int count = slices.length;
        int[][] store = new int[count + 1][canPick + 1];
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= count; i++)
            for (int j = 1; j <= canPick; j++)
                if (i == 1)
                    store[i][j] = slices[0];
                else
                    store[i][j] = Math.max(store[i - 1][j], 
                                           store[i - 2][j - 1] + slices[i - 1]);
        
        return store[count][canPick];
    }
```
