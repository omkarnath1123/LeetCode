Link: [302. Smallest Rectangle Enclosing Black Pixels](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-rectangle-enclosing-black-pixels/) <br>
Tag : **Hard**<br>
Lock: **Normal**

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `image` where `0` represents a white pixel and `1` represents a black pixel.

The black pixels are connected (i.e., there is only one black region). Pixels are connected horizontally and vertically.

Given two integers `x` and `y` that represents the location of one of the black pixels, return _the area of the smallest (axis-aligned) rectangle that encloses all black pixels_.

You must write an algorithm with less than `O(mn)` runtime complexity

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/14/pixel-grid.jpg)
```
Input: image = [["0","0","1","0"],["0","1","1","0"],["0","1","0","0"]], x = 0, y = 2
Output: 6
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: image = [["1"]], x = 0, y = 0
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**
-   `m == image.length`
-   `n == image[i].length`
-   `1 <= m, n <= 100`
-   `image[i][j]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
-   `1 <= x < m`
-   `1 <= y < n`
-   `image[x][y] == '1'.`
-   The black pixels in the `image` only form **one component**.

**Solution:**

- [x] [[Breath First Search]]

**Intuition** :
Traversal all the pixels. Keep the maximum and minimum values of black pixels coordinates.

**Algorithm**

We keep four boundaries, `left`, `right`, `top` and `bottom` of the rectangle. Note that `left` and `top` are inclusive while `right` and `bottom` are exclusive. We then traversal all the pixels and update the four boundaries accordingly.

The recipe is following:

-   Initialise left, right, top and bottom
-   Loop through all `(x, y)` coordinates
    -   if `image[x][y]` is black
        -   `left = min(left, x)`
        -   `right = max(right, x + 1)`
        -   `top = min(top, y)`
        -   `bottom = max(bottom, y + 1)`
-   Return `(right - left) * (bottom - top)`

            minY = y,
            maxY = y,
            len = image.length,
            bre = image[0].length;

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            Point poll = queue.poll();
            
            for (int[] dir : dirs) {
                Point next = new Point(poll.x + dir[0], poll.y + dir[1]);
                if (next.x < 0 || next.y < 0 ||
                    next.x >= len || next.y >= bre || 
                    image[next.x][next.y] == '0') continue;
                
                image[next.x][next.y] = '0';
                minX = Math.min(minX, next.x);
                maxX = Math.max(maxX, next.x);
                minY = Math.min(minY, next.y);
                maxY = Math.max(maxY, next.y);
                queue.add(next);
            }
        }
        return (maxX - minX + 1) * (maxY - minY + 1);
    }
    class Point {
        int x, y;
        Point (int x, int y) {
            this.x = x;
            this.y = y;
        }
    }
