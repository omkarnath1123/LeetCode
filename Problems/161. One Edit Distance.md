Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if they are both one edit distance apart, otherwise return `false`.

A string `s` is said to be one distance apart from a string `t` if you can:

-   Insert **exactly one** character into `s` to get `t`.
-   Delete **exactly one** character from `s` to get `t`.
-   Replace **exactly one** character of `s` with **a different character** to get `t`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "ab", t = "acb"
Output: true
Explanation: We can insert 'c' into s to get t.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "", t = ""
Output: false
Explanation: We cannot get t from s by only one step.
```

**Constraints:**
-   `0 <= s.length, t.length <= 104`
-   `s` and `t` consist of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and digits.



**Solution:**

- [x] [[Two Pointer]]

**Intuition** :

First of all, let's ensure that the string lengths are not too far from each other. If the length difference is 2 or more characters, then `s` and `t` couldn't be one edit away strings.

For the next let's assume that `s` is always shorter or the same length as `t`. If not, one could always call `isOneEditDistance(t, s)` to inverse the string order.
Now it's time to pass along the strings and to look for the first different character.
If there is no differences between the first `len(s)` characters, only two situations are possible :
-   The strings are equal.
-   The strings are one edit away distance.

Now what if there _is_ a different character so that `s[i] != t[i]`.
-   If the strings are of the same length, _all_ next characters should be equal to keep one edit away distance. To verify it, one has to compare the substrings of `s` and `t` both starting from the `i + 1`th character.
-   If `t` is one character longer than `s`, the additional character `t[i]` should be the only difference between both strings. To verify it, one has to compare a substring of `s` starting from the `i`th character and a substring of `t` starting from the `i + 1`th character.
