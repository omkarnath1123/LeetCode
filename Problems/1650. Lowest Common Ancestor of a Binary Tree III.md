Tag : **Medium**<br>
Lock: **Premium**

Given two nodes of a binary tree `p` and `q`, return _their lowest common ancestor (LCA)_.

Each node will have a reference to its parent node. The definition for `Node` is below:

```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node left;
    public Node right;
    public Node parent;
}
```

According to the **[definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor)**: "The lowest common ancestor of two nodes p and q in a tree T is the lowest node that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**)."

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png)
```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png)
```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5 since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**
-   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 105]`.
-   `-109 <= Node.val <= 109`
-   All `Node.val` are **unique**.
-   `p != q`
-   `p` and `q` exist in the tree.

**Solution:**
- [x]  [[Depth First Search]] 

**Intuition** :
1.  Get depth of each nodes.
2.  Level the nodes such that they are equal depth.
3.  In a loop visit their parents while they are not pointing to the same node.

```
n = node in the tree
```
**Time Complexity** : O(n)<br>
**Space Complexity** : O(1)

```java
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node left;
    public Node right;
    public Node parent;
};
*/

class Solution {
    public Node lowestCommonAncestor(Node one, Node two) {

        int distOne = distanceFromRoot(one),
                distTwo = distanceFromRoot(two);

        int diff = Math.abs(distOne - distTwo);
        if (distOne > distTwo) one = moveUpDistance(diff, one);
        else two = moveUpDistance(diff, two);

        while (one != null && two != null && one != two) {
            one = one.parent;
            two = two.parent;
        }
        return one;
    }
    private Node moveUpDistance(int distance, Node node) {
        for (int i = 0; i < distance; i++)
            node = node.parent;
        return node;
    }
    private int distanceFromRoot(Node node) {
        
        int distance = 0;
        for (Node iter = node; iter != null; iter = iter.parent)
            distance++;
        return distance;
    }
}
