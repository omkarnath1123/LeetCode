Link: [791. Custom Sort String](https://leetcode.com/problems/custom-sort-string/) <br>
Tag : **Medium**<br>
Lock: **Normal**

You are given two strings `order` and `s`. All the characters of `order` are **unique** and were sorted in some custom order previously.

Permute the characters of `s` so that they match the order that `order` was sorted. More specifically, if a character `x` occurs before a character `y` in `order`, then `x` should occur before `y` in the permuted string.

Return _any permutation of_ `s` _that satisfies this property_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:  order = "cba", s = "abcd" 

Output:  "cbad" 

Explanation: "a", "b", "c" appear in order, so the order of "a", "b", "c" should be "c", "b", and "a".

Since "d" does not appear in order, it can be at any position in the returned string. "dcba", "cdba", "cbda" are also valid outputs.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:  order = "bcafg", s = "abcd" 

Output:  "bcad" 

Explanation: The characters "b", "c", and "a" from order dictate the order for the characters in s. The character "d" in s does not appear in order, so its position is flexible.

Following the order of appearance in order, "b", "c", and "a" from s should be arranged as "b", "c", "a". "d" can be placed at any position since it's not in order. The output "bcad" correctly follows this rule. Other arrangements like "bacd" or "bcda" would also be valid, as long as "b", "c", "a" maintain their order.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= order.length <= 26`
- `1 <= s.length <= 200`
- `order` and `s` consist of lowercase English letters.
- All the characters of `order` are **unique**.

**Solution:**

- [x]  [[Sorting]]

**Intuition** :

A comparator is a tool used to define (or redefine) an order between two items of the same class or data type. Most languages allow for the use of a custom comparator. This means that we can define a rule that determines how an array is sorted, and leverage built-in sort functions for custom sort.

```
n = length of string

**Time Complexity** : O(n*log(n))<br>
**Space Complexity** : O(n)

```java
    public String customSortString(String order, String s) {
        
        int len = s.length();
        Map<Character, Integer> index = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < order.length(); i++)
            index.put(order.charAt(i), i);
        
        Comparator<Character> comparator = new Comparator<>(){
            @Override
            public int compare(Character one, Character two) {
                int oneIndex = index.getOrDefault(one, Integer.MAX_VALUE),
                    twoIndex = index.getOrDefault(two, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
                return Integer.compare(oneIndex, twoIndex);
            }
        };
        Character[] sorted = new Character[len];
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) sorted[i] = s.charAt(i);
        Arrays.sort(sorted, comparator);
        
        StringBuilder res = new StringBuilder();
        for (char ch : sorted) res.append(ch);
        return res.toString();
    }
```
