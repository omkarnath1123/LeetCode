Tag : **Hard**<br>
Lock: **Normal**

Given a **binary tree** `root`, return _the maximum sum of all keys of **any** sub-tree which is also a Binary Search Tree (BST)_.

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

-   The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
-   The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
-   Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/30/sample_1_1709.png)
```
Input: root = [1,4,3,2,4,2,5,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,6]
Output: 20
Explanation: Maximum sum in a valid Binary search tree is obtained in root node with key equal to 3.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/30/sample_2_1709.png)
```
Input: root = [4,3,null,1,2]
Output: 2
Explanation: Maximum sum in a valid Binary search tree is obtained in a single root node with key equal to 2.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: root = [-4,-2,-5]
Output: 0
Explanation: All values are negatives. Return an empty BST.
```

**Constraints:**
-   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 4 * 104]`.
-   `-4 * 104 <= Node.val <= 4 * 104`

**Solution:**

- [x] [[Depth First Search]]

**Intuition** :

At each node we want to know 2 things:
-   Is this node the root of a valid BST?
-   What is the sum of the subtree?

If we know these 2 pieces of information about each node, then finding the final solution is trivial.

```
n = the no. of nodes in the binary tree
h = the height of the binary tree
```
**Time Complexity** : O(n)<br>
**Space Complexity** : O(h)
