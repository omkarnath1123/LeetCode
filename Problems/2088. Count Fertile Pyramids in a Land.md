Tag : **Hard**<br>
Lock: **Normal**

A farmer has a **rectangular grid** of land with `m` rows and `n` columns that can be divided into unit cells. Each cell is either **fertile** (represented by a `1`) or **barren** (represented by a `0`). All cells outside the grid are considered barren.

A **pyramidal plot** of land can be defined as a set of cells with the following criteria:

1.  The number of cells in the set has to be **greater than** `1` and all cells must be **fertile**.
2.  The **apex** of a pyramid is the **topmost** cell of the pyramid. The **height** of a pyramid is the number of rows it covers. Let `(r, c)` be the apex of the pyramid, and its height be `h`. Then, the plot comprises of cells `(i, j)` where `r <= i <= r + h - 1` **and** `c - (i - r) <= j <= c + (i - r)`.

An **inverse pyramidal plot** of land can be defined as a set of cells with similar criteria:

1.  The number of cells in the set has to be **greater than** `1` and all cells must be **fertile**.
2.  The **apex** of an inverse pyramid is the **bottommost** cell of the inverse pyramid. The **height** of an inverse pyramid is the number of rows it covers. Let `(r, c)` be the apex of the pyramid, and its height be `h`. Then, the plot comprises of cells `(i, j)` where `r - h + 1 <= i <= r` **and** `c - (r - i) <= j <= c + (r - i)`.

Some examples of valid and invalid pyramidal (and inverse pyramidal) plots are shown below. Black cells indicate fertile cells.

Given a **0-indexed** `m x n` binary matrix `grid` representing the farmland, return _the **total number** of pyramidal and inverse pyramidal plots that can be found in_ `grid`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/22/1.JPG)

```
Input: grid = [[0,1,1,0],[1,1,1,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The 2 possible pyramidal plots are shown in blue and red respectively.
There are no inverse pyramidal plots in this grid. 
Hence total number of pyramidal and inverse pyramidal plots is 2 + 0 = 2.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/22/2.JPG)

```
Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The pyramidal plot is shown in blue, and the inverse pyramidal plot is shown in red. 
Hence the total number of plots is 1 + 1 = 2.
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/22/3.JPG)

```
Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,0],[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1],[0,1,0,0,1]]
Output: 13
Explanation: There are 7 pyramidal plots, 3 of which are shown in the 2nd and 3rd figures.
There are 6 inverse pyramidal plots, 2 of which are shown in the last figure.
The total number of plots is 7 + 6 = 13.
```

**Constraints:**
-   `m == grid.length`
-   `n == grid[i].length`
-   `1 <= m, n <= 1000`
-   `1 <= m * n <= 105`
-   `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.


**Solution:**

- [x] [[Dynamic Programming]] + [[Top-Down Solution]]

**Intuition** :
The center of a pyramid with height `h` must be right below the center of a pyramid with height `h - 1` (or greater).

We count consecutive land in a row. For a given count `cnt`, we can potentially have pyramids with `h` from `1` up to `(cnt - 1) / 2`. So, we check the height of pyramids above each potential pyramid (`g[i - 1][j - h]`). If a new pyramid can be formed, we mark its center with `h + 1` - so that we can use it to quickly check pyramids below.
