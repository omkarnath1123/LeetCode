Lock: **Normal**

You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return _the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount_. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
Output: -1
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: coins = [1], amount = 0
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**
-   `1 <= coins.length <= 12`
-   `1 <= coins[i] <= 231 - 1`
-   `0 <= amount <= 104`

**Solution:**
- [x] [[Dynamic Programming]] +[[Top-Down Solution]]

**Intuition** :
The idea is very classic dynamic programming: think of the last step we take. Suppose we have already found out the best way to sum up to amount `a`, then for the last step, we can choose any coin type which gives us a remainder `r` where `r = a-coins[i]` for all `i`'s. For every remainder, go through exactly the same process as before until either the remainder is 0 or less than 0 (meaning not a valid solution). With this idea, the only remaining detail is to store the minimum number of coins needed to sum up to `r` so that we don't need to recompute it over and over again.

```
n = no. of coins
m = amount
```
**Time Complexity** : O(n*m)<br>
**Space Complexity** : O(m)

```java
    Map<Integer, Long> cache;
    public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
        cache = new HashMap<>();
        
        long comb = getCoinsComb(coins, amount);
        return comb >= Integer.MAX_VALUE ? -1 : (int) comb;
    }
    private long getCoinsComb(int[] coins, int amount) {
        if (amount == 0)
            return 0;
        if (cache.containsKey(amount))
            return cache.get(amount);
        
        long comb = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int coin : coins)
            if (amount - coin >= 0)
                comb = Math.min(comb, getCoinsComb(coins, amount - coin) + 1);
        
        cache.put(amount, comb);
        return comb;
    }
```
