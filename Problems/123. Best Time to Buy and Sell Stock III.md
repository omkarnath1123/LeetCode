Tag : **Hard**<br>
Lock: **Normal**

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete **at most two transactions**.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**
```
Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

**Constraints:**
-   `1 <= prices.length <= 105`
-   `0 <= prices[i] <= 105`


**Solution:**

- [x] [[Greedy]]

**Intuition** :
Assume we only have 0 money at first:
4 Variables to maintain some interested 'ceilings' so far:  
The maximum of if we've just buy 1st stock, if we've just sold 1nd stock, if we've just buy 2nd stock, if we've just sold 2nd stock.

```java
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if (Objects.isNull(prices) || prices.length == 0) return 0;
        
        int buyOne = Integer.MIN_VALUE, buyTwo = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int sellOne = 0, sellTwo = 0;
        
        for (int price : prices) {
            buyOne = Math.max(buyOne, - price);
            sellOne = Math.max(sellOne, buyOne + price);
            buyTwo = Math.max(buyTwo, sellOne - price);
            sellTwo = Math.max(sellTwo, buyTwo + price);
        }
        return sellTwo;
    }
```


- [x] [[Utils/Dynamic Programming]] + [[Top-Down Solution]]

**Intuition** :
This approach can be used for all the problems based on stock prices.
The idea is to design a state machine that correctly describes the problem statement.

**Intuition behind the state diagram:**  
We begin at state `0`, where we can either rest (i.e. do nothing) or buy stock at a given price.
-   If we choose to rest, we remain in state `0`
-   If we buy, we spend some money (price of the stock on that day) and go to state `1`

From state `1`, we can once again choose to do nothing or we can sell our stock.
-   If we choose to rest, we remain in state `1`
-   If we sell, we earn some money (price of the stock on that day) and go to state `2`

This completes one transaction for us. Remember, we can only do _atmost_ 2 transactions.
From state `2`, we can choose to do nothing or buy more stock.

-   If we choose to rest, we remain in state `2`
-   If we buy, we go to state `3`

From state `3`, we can once again choose to do nothing or we can sell our stock for the last time.
-   If we choose to rest, we remain in state `3`
-   If we sell, we have utilized our allowed transactions and reach the final state `4`

```java
    Map<String, Integer> store;
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        store = new HashMap<>();
        return backTrack(0, prices, State.BUY, 2);
    }
    private int backTrack(int index, int[] prices, State state, int transaction) {
        if (transaction < 0 || index >= prices.length) 
            return 0;
        
        String key = index + "|" + transaction + "|" + state;
        if (store.containsKey(key))
            return store.get(key);
        
        int profit = backTrack(index + 1, prices, state, transaction);
        if (state == State.BUY) {
            profit = Math.max(profit, backTrack(index + 1, prices, State.SELL, transaction - 1) - prices[index]);
        } else {
            profit = Math.max(profit, backTrack(index + 1, prices, State.BUY, transaction) + prices[index]);
        }
        store.put(key, profit);
        return profit;
    }
    enum State {BUY, SELL}
