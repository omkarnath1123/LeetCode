On a campus represented on the X-Y plane, there are `n` workers and `m` bikes, with `n <= m`.

You are given an array `workers` of length `n` where `workers[i] = [xi, yi]` is the position of the `ith` worker. You are also given an array `bikes` of length `m` where `bikes[j] = [xj, yj]` is the position of the `jth` bike. All the given positions are **unique**.

Assign a bike to each worker. Among the available bikes and workers, we choose the `(workeri, bikej)` pair with the shortest **Manhattan distance** between each other and assign the bike to that worker.

If there are multiple `(workeri, bikej)` pairs with the same shortest **Manhattan distance**, we choose the pair with **the smallest worker index**. If there are multiple ways to do that, we choose the pair with **the smallest bike index**. Repeat this process until there are no available workers.

Return _an array_ `answer` _of length_ `n`_, where_ `answer[i]` _is the index (**0-indexed**) of the bike that the_ `ith` _worker is assigned to_.

The **Manhattan distance** between two points `p1` and `p2` is `Manhattan(p1, p2) = |p1.x - p2.x| + |p1.y - p2.y|`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/03/06/1261_example_1_v2.png)
```
Input: workers = [[0,0],[2,1]], bikes = [[1,2],[3,3]]
Output: [1,0]
Explanation: Worker 1 grabs Bike 0 as they are closest (without ties), and Worker 0 is assigned Bike 1. So the output is [1, 0].
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/03/06/1261_example_2_v2.png)
```
Input: workers = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,0]], bikes = [[1,0],[2,2],[2,1]]
Output: [0,2,1]
Explanation: Worker 0 grabs Bike 0 at first. Worker 1 and Worker 2 share the same distance to Bike 2, thus Worker 1 is assigned to Bike 2, and Worker 2 will take Bike 1. So the output is [0,2,1].
```

**Constraints:**
-   `n == workers.length`
-   `m == bikes.length`
-   `1 <= n <= m <= 1000`
-   `workers[i].length == bikes[j].length == 2`
-   `0 <= xi, yi < 1000`
-   `0 <= xj, yj < 1000`
-   All worker and bike locations are **unique**.

**Solution:**
- [x] [[Greedy]]

**Intuition** :
**Note**: Our goal is to order the pairs according to distance first, then worker index, then bike index. Grouping the pairs by distance allows us to iterate over the groups of pairs in ascending order of distance. In bucket sort, normally, our next step is to sort each bucket to ensure that the `{worker index, bike index}` pairs are in ascending order within each bucket. However, when creating these pairs, we iterated over the worker indices in ascending order and then over the bike indices in ascending order. So it is guaranteed that the pairs are already in ascending order within each bucket! Thus, each bucket does not need to be sorted.

**Algorithm**

1.  Generate all the `(worker, bike)` pairs, and for each pair, find the Manhattan distance, `distance`. Add this pair to the list `disToPairs` corresponding to the index `distance`.
2.  Among all the pairs generated, store the minimum distance in the variable `minDis`.
3.  Initialize `currDis` to `minDis`. Until all the workers have been assigned a bike, do the following:
    -   Iterate over the pairs with distance `currDis`
    -   If the worker and bike are available, assign the bike to the worker in the list `workerStatus` and mark the bike unavailable in `bikeStatus`. Increment the value of `pairCount` which is the value of worker-bike pairs that have been made.
    -   Once all the pairs with the current distance have been traversed, increment the value of `currDis`.
4.  Return `workerStatus`.

```
n = is the number of workers
m = is the number of bikes
k = is the maximum possible Manhattan distance of a worker/bike pair
