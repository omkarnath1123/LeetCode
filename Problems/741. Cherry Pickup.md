Tag : **Hard**<br>
Lock: **Normal**

You are given an `n x n` `grid` representing a field of cherries, each cell is one of three possible integers.

-   `0` means the cell is empty, so you can pass through,
-   `1` means the cell contains a cherry that you can pick up and pass through, or
-   `-1` means the cell contains a thorn that blocks your way.

Return _the maximum number of cherries you can collect by following the rules below_:

-   Starting at the position `(0, 0)` and reaching `(n - 1, n - 1)` by moving right or down through valid path cells (cells with value `0` or `1`).
-   After reaching `(n - 1, n - 1)`, returning to `(0, 0)` by moving left or up through valid path cells.
-   When passing through a path cell containing a cherry, you pick it up, and the cell becomes an empty cell `0`.
-   If there is no valid path between `(0, 0)` and `(n - 1, n - 1)`, then no cherries can be collected.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/14/grid.jpg)
```
Input: grid = [[0,1,-1],[1,0,-1],[1,1,1]]
Output: 5
Explanation: The player started at (0, 0) and went down, down, right right to reach (2, 2).
4 cherries were picked up during this single trip, and the matrix becomes [[0,1,-1],[0,0,-1],[0,0,0]].
Then, the player went left, up, up, left to return home, picking up one more cherry.
The total number of cherries picked up is 5, and this is the maximum possible.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: grid = [[1,1,-1],[1,-1,1],[-1,1,1]]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**
-   `n == grid.length`
-   `n == grid[i].length`
-   `1 <= n <= 50`
-   `grid[i][j]` is `-1`, `0`, or `1`.
-   `grid[0][0] != -1`
-   `grid[n - 1][n - 1] != -1`

**Solution:**

- [x] [[Dynamic Programming]]

**Intuition** :

Let `dp[r1][c1][c2]` be the most number of cherries obtained by two people starting at `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` and walking towards `(N-1, N-1)` picking up cherries, where `r2 = r1+c1-c2`.

If `grid[r1][c1]` and `grid[r2][c2]` are not thorns, then the value of `dp[r1][c1][c2]` is `(grid[r1][c1] + grid[r2][c2])`, plus the maximum of `dp[r1+1][c1][c2]`, `dp[r1][c1+1][c2]`, `dp[r1+1][c1][c2+1]`, `dp[r1][c1+1][c2+1]` as appropriate. We should also be careful to not double count in case `(r1, c1) == (r2, c2)`.

Why did we say it was the maximum of `dp[r+1][c1][c2]` etc.? It corresponds to the 4 possibilities for person 1 and 2 moving down and right:

-   Person 1 down and person 2 down: `dp[r1+1][c1][c2]`;
-   Person 1 right and person 2 down: `dp[r1][c1+1][c2]`;
-   Person 1 down and person 2 right: `dp[r1+1][c1][c2+1]`;
-   Person 1 right and person 2 right: `dp[r1][c1+1][c2+1]`;
