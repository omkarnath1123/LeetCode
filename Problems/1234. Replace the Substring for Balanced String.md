Link: [1234. Replace the Substring for Balanced String](https://leetcode.com/problems/replace-the-substring-for-balanced-string/) <br>
Tag : **Medium**<br>
Lock: **Normal**

You are given a string s of length `n` containing only four kinds of characters: `'Q'`, `'W'`, `'E'`, and `'R'`.

A string is said to be **balanced** if each of its characters appears `n / 4` times where `n` is the length of the string.

Return _the minimum length of the substring that can be replaced with **any** other string of the same length to make_ `s` _**balanced**_. If s is already **balanced**, return `0`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "QWER"
Output: 0
Explanation: s is already balanced.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "QQWE"
Output: 1
Explanation: We need to replace a 'Q' to 'R', so that "RQWE" (or "QRWE") is balanced.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "QQQW"
Output: 2
Explanation: We can replace the first "QQ" to "ER". 
```

**Constraints:**
-   `n == s.length`
-   `4 <= n <= 105`
-   `n` is a multiple of `4`.
-   `s` contains only `'Q'`, `'W'`, `'E'`, and `'R'`.


**Solution:**

- [x] [[Sliding Window]]

**Intuition** :
We want a minimum length of substring,  
which leads us to the solution of sliding window.  
Specilly this time we don't care the count of elements inside the window,  
we want to know the count outside the window.  

**Explanation**

One pass the all frequency of `"QWER"`.  
Then slide the windon in the string `s`.

Imagine that we erase all character inside the window,  
as we can modyfy it whatever we want,  
and it will always increase the count outside the window.

So we can make the whole string balanced,  
as long as `max(count[Q],count[W],count[E],count[R]) <= n / 4`.

```
n = is the length of stations
```
**Time Complexity** : O(n)<br>
**Space Complexity** : O(n)

```java
    public int balancedString(String s) {
        
        int len = s.length(),
            balance = len / 4,
            start = 0,
            minLen = len;
        int[] freq = new int[26];
        
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray())
            freq[ch - 'A']++;
        
        for (int end = 0; end < len; end++) {
            int index = s.charAt(end) - 'A';
            freq[index]--;
            
            while (start < len && 
                   freq['Q' - 'A'] <= balance && 
                   freq['W' - 'A'] <= balance && 
                   freq['E' - 'A'] <= balance && 
                   freq['R' - 'A'] <= balance) {
                index = s.charAt(start) - 'A';
                minLen = Math.min(minLen, end - start + 1);
                freq[index]++;
                start++;
            }
        }
        return minLen;
    }
```
