Link: [1697. Checking Existence of Edge Length Limited Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/checking-existence-of-edge-length-limited-paths/) <br>
Tag : **Hard**<br>
Lock: **Normal**

An undirected graph of `n` nodes is defined by `edgeList`, where `edgeList[i] = [ui, vi, disi]` denotes an edge between nodes `ui` and `vi` with distance `disi`. Note that there may be **multiple** edges between two nodes.

Given an array `queries`, where `queries[j] = [pj, qj, limitj]`, your task is to determine for each `queries[j]` whether there is a path between `pj` and `qj` such that each edge on the path has a distance **strictly less than** `limitj` .

Return _a **boolean array**_ `answer`_, where_ `answer.length == queries.length` _and the_ `jth` _value of_ `answer` _is_ `true` _if there is a path for_ `queries[j]` _is_ `true`_, and_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/08/h.png)
```
Input: n = 3, edgeList = [[0,1,2],[1,2,4],[2,0,8],[1,0,16]], queries = [[0,1,2],[0,2,5]]
Output: [false,true]
Explanation: The above figure shows the given graph. Note that there are two overlapping edges between 0 and 1 with distances 2 and 16.
For the first query, between 0 and 1 there is no path where each distance is less than 2, thus we return false for this query.
For the second query, there is a path (0 -> 1 -> 2) of two edges with distances less than 5, thus we return true for this query.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/08/q.png)
```
Input: n = 5, edgeList = [[0,1,10],[1,2,5],[2,3,9],[3,4,13]], queries = [[0,4,14],[1,4,13]]
Output: [true,false]
Exaplanation: The above figure shows the given graph.
```

**Constraints:**
-   `2 <= n <= 105`
-   `1 <= edgeList.length, queries.length <= 105`
-   `edgeList[i].length == 3`
-   `queries[j].length == 3`
-   `0 <= ui, vi, pj, qj <= n - 1`
-   `ui != vi`
-   `pj != qj`
-   `1 <= disi, limitj <= 109`
-   There may be **multiple** edges between two nodes.

**Solution:**
- [x] [[Union-Find]] 

**Intuition** :

**Observation**

The key here is to notice that the queries are offline which means that we can reorganize them however we want.
Now to answer the question, whether there is a path between any two nodes where the maximum edge length or weight is less than `limit`, we can join all the edges whose weight is less than `limit` and if we are still not able to reach one node from the other it essentially means that there is no path between them where edge weight is less than `limit`.

**Solution**

First we need to sort the input `queries` and `edgeList` by edge length or `weight`.
We can now simply use a two pointer approach to `Union` all the nodes whose edges have `weight` less than `query[i]`.
To know if there is a path between them all we need is to know whether their parents (in DSU) are same.

```
e = is the no. of edges in graph
n = is the no. of nodes in graph
