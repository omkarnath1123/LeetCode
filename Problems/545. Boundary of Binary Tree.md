Tag : **Medium**<br>
Lock: **Premium**

The **boundary** of a binary tree is the concatenation of the **root**, the **left boundary**, the **leaves** ordered from left-to-right, and the **reverse order** of the **right boundary**.

The **left boundary** is the set of nodes defined by the following:

-   The root node's left child is in the left boundary. If the root does not have a left child, then the left boundary is **empty**.
-   If a node in the left boundary and has a left child, then the left child is in the left boundary.
-   If a node is in the left boundary, has **no** left child, but has a right child, then the right child is in the left boundary.
-   The leftmost leaf is **not** in the left boundary.

The **right boundary** is similar to the **left boundary**, except it is the right side of the root's right subtree. Again, the leaf is **not** part of the **right boundary**, and the **right boundary** is empty if the root does not have a right child.

The **leaves** are nodes that do not have any children. For this problem, the root is **not** a leaf.

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the values of its **boundary**_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/11/boundary1.jpg)
```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4]
Output: [1,3,4,2]
Explanation:
- The left boundary is empty because the root does not have a left child.
- The right boundary follows the path starting from the root's right child 2 -> 4.
  4 is a leaf, so the right boundary is [2].
- The leaves from left to right are [3,4].
Concatenating everything results in [1] + [] + [3,4] + [2] = [1,3,4,2].
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/11/boundary2.jpg)
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10]
Output: [1,2,4,7,8,9,10,6,3]
Explanation:
- The left boundary follows the path starting from the root's left child 2 -> 4.
  4 is a leaf, so the left boundary is [2].
- The right boundary follows the path starting from the root's right child 3 -> 6 -> 10.
  10 is a leaf, so the right boundary is [3,6], and in reverse order is [6,3].
- The leaves from left to right are [4,7,8,9,10].
Concatenating everything results in [1] + [2] + [4,7,8,9,10] + [6,3] = [1,2,4,7,8,9,10,6,3].
```

**Constraints:**
-   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
-   `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

**Solution:**
- [x] [[Depth First Search]]

**Intuition** :
One simple approach is to divide this problem into three subproblems- left boundary, leaves and right boundary.

-   Left Boundary: We keep on traversing the tree towards the left and keep on adding the nodes in the res array, provided the current node isn't a leaf node. If at any point, we can't find the left child of a node, but its right child exists, we put the right child in the res and continue the process. The following animation depicts the process.
-   Leaf Nodes: We make use of a recursive function `addLeaves(res,root)`, in which we change the root node for every recursive call. If the current root node happens to be a leaf node, it is added to the res array. Otherwise, we make the recursive call using the left child of the current node as the new root. After this, we make the recursive call using the right child of the current node as the new root. The following animation depicts the process.
-   Right Boundary: We perform the same process as the left boundary. But, this time, we traverse towards the right. If the right child doesn't exist, we move towards the left child. Also, instead of putting the traversed nodes in the res array, we push them over a stack during the traversal. After the complete traversal is done, we pop the element from over the stack and append them to the res array. The following animation depicts the process.

```
n = nodes in tree

```java
    List<Integer> boundry;
    public List<Integer> boundaryOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        
        boundry = new LinkedList<>();
        if (root == null) 
            return boundry;
        
        boundry.add(root.val);
        if (root.left == null && root.right == null) 
            return boundry;
        
        traverseLeft(root.left);
        tarverseBottom(root);
        traverseRight(root.right);
        return boundry;
    }
    private void traverseLeft(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) return;
        if (node.left == null && node.right == null) return;
        
        boundry.add(node.val);
        if (node.left != null) traverseLeft(node.left);
        else traverseLeft(node.right);
    }
    private void tarverseBottom(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) return;
        if (node.left == null && node.right == null)
            boundry.add(node.val);
        
        tarverseBottom(node.left);
        tarverseBottom(node.right);
    }
    private void traverseRight(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) return;
        if (node.left == null && node.right == null) return;
        
        if (node.right != null) traverseRight(node.right);
        else traverseRight(node.left);
        boundry.add(node.val);
    }
