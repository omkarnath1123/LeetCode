In this problem, a tree is an **undirected graph** that is connected and has no cycles.

You are given a graph that started as a tree with `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`, with one additional edge added. The added edge has two **different** vertices chosen from `1` to `n`, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an array `edges` of length `n` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the graph.

Return _an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of_ `n` _nodes_. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: [2,3]
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/02/reduntant1-2-graph.jpg)
```
Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,4],[1,5]]
Output: [1,4]
```

**Constraints:**
-   `n == edges.length`
-   `3 <= n <= 1000`
-   `edges[i].length == 2`
-   `1 <= ai < bi <= edges.length`
-   `ai != bi`
-   There are no repeated edges.
-   The given graph is connected.


**Solution:**

- [x] [[Union-Find]]

**Intuition** :
We use two techniques to improve the run-time complexity: _path compression_, and _union-by-rank_.

-   Path compression involves changing the `x = parent[x]` in the `find` function to `parent[x] = find(parent[x])`. Basically, as we compute the correct leader for x, we should remember our calculation.
    
-   Union-by-rank involves distributing the workload of `find` across leaders evenly. Whenever we `dsu.union(x, y)`, we have two leaders `xr, yr` and we have to choose whether we want `parent[x] = yr` or `parent[y] = xr`. We choose the leader that has a higher following to pick up a new follower.  
    Specifically, the meaning of `rank` is that there are less than `2 ^ rank[x]` followers of `x`. This strategy can be shown to give us better bounds for how long the recursive loop in `dsu.find` could run for.
