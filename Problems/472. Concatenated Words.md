Given an array of strings `words` (**without duplicates**), return _all the **concatenated words** in the given list of_ `words`.

A **concatenated word** is defined as a string that is comprised entirely of at least two shorter words in the given array.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: words = ["cat","cats","catsdogcats","dog","dogcatsdog","hippopotamuses","rat","ratcatdogcat"]
Output: ["catsdogcats","dogcatsdog","ratcatdogcat"]
Explanation: "catsdogcats" can be concatenated by "cats", "dog" and "cats"; 
"dogcatsdog" can be concatenated by "dog", "cats" and "dog"; 
"ratcatdogcat" can be concatenated by "rat", "cat", "dog" and "cat".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: words = ["cat","dog","catdog"]
Output: ["catdog"]
```

**Constraints:**
-   `1 <= words.length <= 104`
-   `0 <= words[i].length <= 30`
-   `words[i]` consists of only lowercase English letters.
-   `0 <= sum(words[i].length) <= 105`

**Solution:**

- [x] [[Dynamic Programming]] + [[Bottom-Up Solution]]

**Intuition** :
If you do know one optimized solution for above question is using `DP`, this problem is just one more step further. We iterate through each `word` and see if it can be formed by using other `words`.

Of course it is also obvious that a `word` can only be formed by `words` shorter than it. So we can first sort the input by length of each `word`, and only try to form one `word` by using `words` in front of it.

```
n = no. of words
m = len of the longesst word
```

    public List<String> findAllConcatenatedWordsInADict(String[] words) {
        
        Arrays.sort(words, (String one, String two) ->  Integer.compare(one.length(), two.length()));
        List<String> canFormed = new LinkedList<>();
        Set<String> dict = new HashSet<>();
        for (String word : words) {
            if (canCreate(word, dict))
                canFormed.add(word);
            dict.add(word);
        }
        return canFormed;
    }
    private boolean canCreate(String source, Set<String> dict) {
        if (source.equals("")) return false;
        
        int len = source.length();
        boolean[] store = new boolean[len + 1];
        store[0] = true;
        for (int i = 0; i <= len; i++)
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (!store[j]) continue;
                String prefix = source.substring(j, i);
                if (dict.contains(prefix))
                    store[i] = true;
            }
        return store[len];
    }
