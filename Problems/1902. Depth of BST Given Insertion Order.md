You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `order` of length `n`, a **permutation** of integers from `1` to `n` representing the **order** of insertion into a **binary search tree**.

A binary search tree is defined as follows:

-   The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
-   The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
-   Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

The binary search tree is constructed as follows:

-   `order[0]` will be the **root** of the binary search tree.
-   All subsequent elements are inserted as the **child** of **any** existing node such that the binary search tree properties hold.

Return _the **depth** of the binary search tree_.

A binary tree's **depth** is the number of **nodes** along the **longest path** from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: order = [2,1,4,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: The binary search tree has a depth of 3 with path 2->3->4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: order = [2,1,3,4]
Output: 3
Explanation: The binary search tree has a depth of 3 with path 2->3->4.
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/15/3.png)
```
Input: order = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: The binary search tree has a depth of 4 with path 1->2->3->4.
```

**Constraints:**
-   `n == order.length`
-   `1 <= n <= 105`
-   `order` is a permutation of integers between `1` and `n`.

**Solution:**

- [x] [[Ordered Set]]

**Intuition** :
Since all elements are unique and within `[1..n]`, we can represent our tree as intervals.

We start with `[1..n]` interval, and the depth of that interval is `0`. When we insert, say, 3, we split that interval into two: `[1..2]` and `[4..n]`, and increment their depth. For any value, we can quickly find it's interval using binary search.

The picture below demonstrates how we split intervals for this test case: `[3,5,1,2,6,7,4]`

To model this logic, we can use a map to store numbers and their depth. When we insert a new number, we first find the insert position (O(n log )). Then, we get the depth of numbers on the left and right (our interval). Finally, we insert a new value, and its depth is the maximum depth of the neighbours, plus `1`.

```
n = is length of order
```
**Time Complexity** : O(n log(n))<br>
**Space Complexity** : O(n)

```java
    public int maxDepthBST(int[] order) {
        
        int maxLen = 0;
        TreeMap<Integer, Integer> store = new TreeMap<>();
        for (int num : order) {
            
            Integer floor = store.floorKey(num),
                    ceiling = store.ceilingKey(num);
            
            int height = Math.max(
                floor == null ? 0 : store.get(floor), 
                ceiling == null ? 0 : store.get(ceiling));
            maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, height + 1);
            store.put(num, height + 1);
        }
        return maxLen;
    }
```
