Given the `postfix` tokens of an arithmetic expression, build and return _the binary expression tree that represents this expression._

**Postfix** notation is a notation for writing arithmetic expressions in which the operands (numbers) appear before their operators. For example, the postfix tokens of the expression `4*(5-(7+2))` are represented in the array `postfix = ["4","5","7","2","+","-","*"]`.

The class `Node` is an interface you should use to implement the binary expression tree. The returned tree will be tested using the `evaluate` function, which is supposed to evaluate the tree's value. You should not remove the `Node` class; however, you can modify it as you wish, and you can define other classes to implement it if needed.

A **[binary expression tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_expression_tree)** is a kind of binary tree used to represent arithmetic expressions. Each node of a binary expression tree has either zero or two children. Leaf nodes (nodes with 0 children) correspond to operands (numbers), and internal nodes (nodes with two children) correspond to the operators `'+'` (addition), `'-'` (subtraction), `'*'` (multiplication), and `'/'` (division).

It's guaranteed that no subtree will yield a value that exceeds `109` in absolute value, and all the operations are valid (i.e., no division by zero).

**Follow up:** Could you design the expression tree such that it is more modular? For example, is your design able to support additional operators without making changes to your existing `evaluate` implementation?

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/15/untitled-diagram.png)
```
Input: s = ["3","4","+","2","*","7","/"]
Output: 2
Explanation: this expression evaluates to the above binary tree with expression ((3+4)*2)/7) = 14/7 = 2.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/15/untitled-diagram2.png)
```
Input: s = ["4","5","2","7","+","-","*"]
Output: -16
Explanation: this expression evaluates to the above binary tree with expression 4*(5-(2+7)) = 4*(-4) = -16.
```

**Constraints:**
-   `1 <= s.length < 100`
-   `s.length` is odd.
-   `s` consists of numbers and the characters `'+'`, `'-'`, `'*'`, and `'/'`.
-   If `s[i]` is a number, its integer representation is no more than `105`.
-   It is guaranteed that `s` is a valid expression.
-   The absolute value of the result and intermediate values will not exceed `109`.
-   It is guaranteed that no expression will include division by zero.

**Solution:**

- [x] [[Depth First Search]]

**Intuition** :
create a node class that will evaluate the expression in the depth first search manner. 

```
n = the no. of operations in the postfix string
```
**Time Complexity** : O(n)<br>
**Space Complexity** : O(n)

```java
/**
 * This is the interface for the expression tree Node.
 * You should not remove it, and you can define some classes to implement it.
 */

abstract class Node {
    public abstract int evaluate();
    // define your fields here
};

class TreeNode extends Node {
    String val;
    TreeNode left = null, right = null;
    TreeNode (String val) {
        this.val = val;
    }
    TreeNode (String val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
    
    public int evaluate() {
        if (left == null && right == null)
            return Integer.parseInt(val);
        
        int leftRes = left.evaluate(),
            rightRes = right.evaluate();
        if (val.equals("+")) return leftRes + rightRes;
        else if (val.equals("-")) return leftRes - rightRes;
        else if (val.equals("*")) return leftRes * rightRes;
        else if (val.equals("/")) return leftRes / rightRes;
        return 0;
    }
}


/**
 * This is the TreeBuilder class.
 * You can treat it as the driver code that takes the postinfix input 
 * and returns the expression tree represnting it as a Node.
 */

class TreeBuilder {
    Deque<TreeNode> stack = new LinkedList<>();
    Node buildTree(String[] postfix) {
        
        for (String exp : postfix)
            if (exp.equals("+") || 
                exp.equals("-") || 
                exp.equals("*") || 
                exp.equals("/")) {
                TreeNode one = stack.pollLast(),
                         two = stack.pollLast();
                stack.offerLast(new TreeNode(exp, two, one));
            } else
                stack.offerLast(new TreeNode(exp));
        
        return stack.pollFirst();
    }
};


/**
 * Your TreeBuilder object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * TreeBuilder obj = new TreeBuilder();
 * Node expTree = obj.buildTree(postfix);
 * int ans = expTree.evaluate();
