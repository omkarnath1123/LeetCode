Link: [1041. Robot Bounded In Circle](https://leetcode.com/problems/robot-bounded-in-circle/) <br>
Tag : **Medium**<br>
Lock: **Normal**

On an infinite plane, a robot initially stands at `(0, 0)` and faces north. Note that:

-   The **north direction** is the positive direction of the y-axis.
-   The **south direction** is the negative direction of the y-axis.
-   The **east direction** is the positive direction of the x-axis.
-   The **west direction** is the negative direction of the x-axis.

The robot can receive one of three instructions:

-   `"G"`: go straight 1 unit.
-   `"L"`: turn 90 degrees to the left (i.e., anti-clockwise direction).
-   `"R"`: turn 90 degrees to the right (i.e., clockwise direction).

The robot performs the `instructions` given in order, and repeats them forever.

Return `true` if and only if there exists a circle in the plane such that the robot never leaves the circle.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: instructions = "GGLLGG"
Output: true
Explanation: The robot is initially at (0, 0) facing the north direction.
"G": move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: North.
"G": move one step. Position: (0, 2). Direction: North.
"L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 2). Direction: West.
"L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 2). Direction: South.
"G": move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: South.
"G": move one step. Position: (0, 0). Direction: South.
Repeating the instructions, the robot goes into the cycle: (0, 0) --> (0, 1) --> (0, 2) --> (0, 1) --> (0, 0).
Based on that, we return true.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: instructions = "GG"
Output: false
Explanation: The robot is initially at (0, 0) facing the north direction.
"G": move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: North.
"G": move one step. Position: (0, 2). Direction: North.
Repeating the instructions, keeps advancing in the north direction and does not go into cycles.
Based on that, we return false.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: instructions = "GL"
Output: true
Explanation: The robot is initially at (0, 0) facing the north direction.
"G": move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: North.
"L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 1). Direction: West.
"G": move one step. Position: (-1, 1). Direction: West.
"L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (-1, 1). Direction: South.
"G": move one step. Position: (-1, 0). Direction: South.
"L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (-1, 0). Direction: East.
"G": move one step. Position: (0, 0). Direction: East.
"L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 0). Direction: North.
Repeating the instructions, the robot goes into the cycle: (0, 0) --> (0, 1) --> (-1, 1) --> (-1, 0) --> (0, 0).
Based on that, we return true.
```

**Constraints:**
-   `1 <= instructions.length <= 100`
-   `instructions[i]` is `'G'`, `'L'` or, `'R'`.

**Solution:**
- [x]  [[Hash Table]] 

**Intuition** :
The robot's [trajectory attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor) is a set of trajectories toward which a system tends to evolve. The question may sound a bit theoretical - is this attractor is limited or not. In other words, if there exists a circle in the plane such that the robot never leaves the circle.

Why is it interesting to know? There is a bunch of practical problems related to topology, networks planning, and password brute-forcing. For all these problems, the first thing to understand is do we work within a limited space or the behavior of our system could drastically diverge at some point?

    List<Character> order = new LinkedList<>(Arrays.asList(west, south, east, north));

        instructions = instructions + instructions + instructions + instructions;
        int index = 3;
        Map<Character, Integer> count = new HashMap<>();
        for (char instruction : instructions.toCharArray()) {
            if (instruction == 'L') index++;
            else if (instruction == 'R') index--;

                char dir = order.get(index);
                count.merge(dir, 1, Integer::sum);
            }
            index = (index + 4) % 4;
        }
        return count.getOrDefault(north, 0) == count.getOrDefault(south, 0) && 
                count.getOrDefault(east, 0) == count.getOrDefault(west, 0);
    }
