Given a binary string `s`, return _the **minimum** number of character swaps to make it **alternating**, or_ `-1` _if it is impossible._

The string is called **alternating** if no two adjacent characters are equal. For example, the strings `"010"` and `"1010"` are alternating, while the string `"0100"` is not.

Any two characters may be swapped, even if they are **not adjacent**.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "111000"
Output: 1
Explanation: Swap positions 1 and 4: "111000" -> "101010"
The string is now alternating.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "010"
Output: 0
Explanation: The string is already alternating, no swaps are needed.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "1110"
Output: -1
```

**Constraints:**
-   `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
-   `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.

**Solution:**

- [x] [[Greedy]]

**Intuition** :

-   The key to solve this problem is to count number of indexes which contain wrong character. So for string `s = 11001`, `count` will be 2 as characters at `s[1]` and `s[2]` are wrong. And number of swaps will be `count / 2`. For example, we can just swap character at index `1` and index `2` to obtain `s = 10101`.

**Things to notice**

-   Solving this problem will be impossible if difference between number of ones and number of zeros will be greater than 1.
-   If number of ones is greater than number of zeroes then `1` should be the first character of resulting string. Similarly if number of zeroes is greater than number of ones then `0` should be the first character of resulting string.
-   If number of ones is equal to number of zeroes, we will find minimum number of swaps of both cases:
    -   Case 1 : `1` is the first character.
    -   Case 2 : `0` is the first character.

```java
    private final char ONE = '1';
    private final char ZERO = '0';
    public int minSwaps(String s) {
        
        char[] source = s.toCharArray();
        int zeroOne = 0,
            oneZero = 0,
            len = source.length,
            oneCount = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i = i + 2) {
            if (source[i] == ONE) zeroOne++;
            if (i + 1 < len && source[i + 1] == ZERO) zeroOne++;
            
            if (source[i] == ZERO) oneZero++;
            if (i + 1 < len && source[i + 1] == ONE) oneZero++;
            
            if (source[i] == ONE) oneCount++;
            if (i + 1 < len && source[i + 1] == ONE)  oneCount++;
        }
        int zeroCount = len - oneCount;
        if (len % 2 == 0 && oneCount != zeroCount) 
            return -1;
        if (len % 2 == 1 && Math.abs(oneCount - zeroCount) > 1) 
            return -1;
        if (zeroOne % 2 == 1 && oneZero % 2 == 1) 
            return -1;
        
        if (zeroOne % 2 == 1) return oneZero / 2;
        else if (oneZero % 2 == 1) return zeroOne / 2;
        else return Math.min(zeroOne, oneZero) / 2;
    }
