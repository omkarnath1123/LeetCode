Link: [1834. Single-Threaded CPU](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-threaded-cpu/) <br>
Tag : **Medium**<br>
Lock: **Normal**

You are given `n` tasks labeled from `0` to `n - 1` represented by a 2D integer array `tasks`, where `tasks[i] = [enqueueTimei, processingTimei]` means that the `ith` task will be available to process at `enqueueTimei` and will take `processingTimei` to finish processing.

You have a single-threaded CPU that can process **at most one** task at a time and will act in the following way:

-   If the CPU is idle and there are no available tasks to process, the CPU remains idle.
-   If the CPU is idle and there are available tasks, the CPU will choose the one with the **shortest processing time**. If multiple tasks have the same shortest processing time, it will choose the task with the smallest index.
-   Once a task is started, the CPU will **process the entire task** without stopping.
-   The CPU can finish a task then start a new one instantly.

Return _the order in which the CPU will process the tasks._

**Example 1:**
```
Input: tasks = [[1,2],[2,4],[3,2],[4,1]]
Output: [0,2,3,1]
Explanation: The events go as follows: 
- At time = 1, task 0 is available to process. Available tasks = {0}.
- Also at time = 1, the idle CPU starts processing task 0. Available tasks = {}.
- At time = 2, task 1 is available to process. Available tasks = {1}.
- At time = 3, task 2 is available to process. Available tasks = {1, 2}.
- Also at time = 3, the CPU finishes task 0 and starts processing task 2 as it is the shortest. Available tasks = {1}.
- At time = 4, task 3 is available to process. Available tasks = {1, 3}.
- At time = 5, the CPU finishes task 2 and starts processing task 3 as it is the shortest. Available tasks = {1}.
- At time = 6, the CPU finishes task 3 and starts processing task 1. Available tasks = {}.
- At time = 10, the CPU finishes task 1 and becomes idle.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: tasks = [[7,10],[7,12],[7,5],[7,4],[7,2]]
Output: [4,3,2,0,1]
Explanation: The events go as follows:
- At time = 7, all the tasks become available. Available tasks = {0,1,2,3,4}.
- Also at time = 7, the idle CPU starts processing task 4. Available tasks = {0,1,2,3}.
- At time = 9, the CPU finishes task 4 and starts processing task 3. Available tasks = {0,1,2}.
- At time = 13, the CPU finishes task 3 and starts processing task 2. Available tasks = {0,1}.
- At time = 18, the CPU finishes task 2 and starts processing task 0. Available tasks = {1}.
- At time = 28, the CPU finishes task 0 and starts processing task 1. Available tasks = {}.
- At time = 40, the CPU finishes task 1 and becomes idle.
```

**Constraints:**
-   `tasks.length == n`
-   `1 <= n <= 105`
-   `1 <= enqueueTimei, processingTimei <= 109`

**Solution:**

- [x] [[Heap]]

**Intuition** :
At each integer `i` in the array we can consider it as the end of AP(Arithmetic Progression/Sequence) and check the length of that AP which will be the (length of AP that ends with `i-difference`) `+ 1`. We can thus use a hash-map to store this while traversing the array.

```
n = is the no. of tasks
```
**Time Complexity** : O(n log(n))<br>
**Space Complexity** : O(n)

```java
    public int[] getOrder(int[][] tasks) {
        
        int len = tasks.length,
            index = 0;
        int[] res = new int[len];
        PriorityQueue<Process> order = new PriorityQueue<>((Process one, Process two) -> Integer.compare(one.enqueTime, two.enqueTime));
        
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++)
            order.add(new Process(i, tasks[i][0], tasks[i][1]));
        
        int time = order.peek().enqueTime;
        PriorityQueue<Process> store = new PriorityQueue<>();
        
        while (index != len) {
            while (!order.isEmpty() && time >= order.peek().enqueTime)
                    store.add(order.poll());
            
            if (store.isEmpty()) {

                    store.add(order.poll());
            }
            
            Process poll = store.poll();
            res[index] = poll.index;
            time = time + poll.processTime;
            index++;
        }
        return res;

        int index, enqueTime, processTime;

            this.index = index;
            this.enqueTime = enqueTime;
            this.processTime = processTime;
        }
        @Override
        public int compareTo(Process that) {
            if (this.processTime == that.processTime)
                return Integer.compare(this.index, that.index);
            return Integer.compare(this.processTime, that.processTime);
