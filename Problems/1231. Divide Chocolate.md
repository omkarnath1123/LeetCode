Lock: **Premium**

You have one chocolate bar that consists of some chunks. Each chunk has its own sweetness given by the array `sweetness`.

You want to share the chocolate with your `k` friends so you start cutting the chocolate bar into `k + 1` pieces using `k` cuts, each piece consists of some **consecutive** chunks.

Being generous, you will eat the piece with the **minimum total sweetness** and give the other pieces to your friends.

Find the **maximum total sweetness** of the piece you can get by cutting the chocolate bar optimally.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: sweetness = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], k = 5
Output: 6
Explanation: You can divide the chocolate to [1,2,3], [4,5], [6], [7], [8], [9]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: sweetness = [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], k = 8
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one way to cut the bar into 9 pieces.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: sweetness = [1,2,2,1,2,2,1,2,2], k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: You can divide the chocolate to [1,2,2], [1,2,2], [1,2,2]
```

**Constraints:**
-   `0 <= k < sweetness.length <= 104`
-   `1 <= sweetness[i] <= 105`

**Solution:**
- [x] [[Binary Search]] + [[Greedy]]

**Intuition** :
We want to maximize the minimum sweetness.  
Binary search the result between 1 and 10^9.

**Algorithm**
1.  Set up the two boundaries (`left` and `right`) of the search space, that is: `left = 1`, `right = total / (k + 1)`.
2.  Get the middle value from `left` and `right`, that is `mid = (left + right + 1) / 2`.
3.  Check if we can cut the chocolate into `k + 1` pieces with sweetness no less than `mid`, where `mid` is our current guess at the optimal workable value.
4.  If cutting the chocolate bar in this method results in everyone receiving a piece of chocolate that is at least as sweet as `mid`, then let `left = mid`. Otherwise, let `right = mid - 1`.
5.  Repeat the **steps 2, 3, and 4** until the two boundaries overlap, i.e., `left == right`, which means that you have found the maximum total sweetness of a piece you can receive by cutting the chocolate bar optimally. We can return either `left` or `right` as the answer.

```
s = the total sweetness of the chocolate bar
n = the number of chunks in the chocolate

        for (int piece : sweetness) {
            min = Math.min(min, piece);

        for (int sweet : sweetness) {
            if (currSweet >= minSweetness) {
                chunks--;
                currSweet = sweet;
            } else
                currSweet = currSweet + sweet;
        }
        if (currSweet >= minSweetness) chunks--;
        return chunks <= -1;
    }
