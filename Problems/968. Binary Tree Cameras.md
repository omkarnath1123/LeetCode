Link: [968. Binary Tree Cameras](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-cameras/) <br>
Tag : **Hard**<br>
Lock: **Normal**

You are given the `root` of a binary tree. We install cameras on the tree nodes where each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.

Return _the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/29/bst_cameras_01.png)

```
Input: root = [0,0,null,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/29/bst_cameras_02.png)
```
Input: root = [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. The above image shows one of the valid configurations of camera placement.
```

**Constraints:**
-   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
-   `Node.val == 0`

**Solution:**

- [x] [[Depth First Search]]

**Intuition** :
Mantain and store the states of its child

```
n = the no. of nodes in the tree

**Time Complexity** : O(n)<br>
**Space Complexity** : O(1)

/**

 *     TreeNode() {}

 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
