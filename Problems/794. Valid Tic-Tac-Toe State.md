Lock: **Normal**

Given a Tic-Tac-Toe board as a string array `board`, return `true` if and only if it is possible to reach this board position during the course of a valid tic-tac-toe game.

The board is a `3 x 3` array that consists of characters `' '`, `'X'`, and `'O'`. The `' '` character represents an empty square.

Here are the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:

-   Players take turns placing characters into empty squares `' '`.
-   The first player always places `'X'` characters, while the second player always places `'O'` characters.
-   `'X'` and `'O'` characters are always placed into empty squares, never filled ones.
-   The game ends when there are three of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.
-   The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.
-   No more moves can be played if the game is over.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/15/tictactoe1-grid.jpg)
```
Input: board = ["O  ","   ","   "]
Output: false
Explanation: The first player always plays "X".
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/15/tictactoe2-grid.jpg)
```
Input: board = ["XOX"," X ","   "]
Output: false
Explanation: Players take turns making moves.
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/15/tictactoe4-grid.jpg)
```
Input: board = ["XOX","O O","XOX"]
Output: true
```

**Constraints:**
-   `board.length == 3`
-   `board[i].length == 3`
-   `board[i][j]` is either `'X'`, `'O'`, or `' '`.

**Solution:**

- [x] [[Array]]

**Intuition** :
When `turns` is 1, X moved. When `turns` is 0, O moved. `rows` stores the number of X or O in each row. `cols` stores the number of X or O in each column. `diag` stores the number of X or O in diagonal. `antidiag` stores the number of X or O in anti-diagonal. When any of the value gets to 3, it means X wins. When any of the value gets to -3, it means O wins.

When X wins, O cannot move anymore, so `turns` must be 1. When O wins, X cannot move anymore, so `turns` must be 0. Finally, when we return, `turns` must be either 0 or 1, and X and O cannot win at same time.
