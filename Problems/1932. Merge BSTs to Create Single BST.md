Tag : **Hard**<br>
Lock: **Normal**

You are given `n` **BST (binary search tree) root nodes** for `n` separate BSTs stored in an array `trees` (**0-indexed**). Each BST in `trees` has **at most 3 nodes**, and no two roots have the same value. In one operation, you can:

-   Select two **distinct** indices `i` and `j` such that the value stored at one of the **leaves** of `trees[i]` is equal to the **root value** of `trees[j]`.
-   Replace the leaf node in `trees[i]` with `trees[j]`.
-   Remove `trees[j]` from `trees`.

Return _the **root** of the resulting BST if it is possible to form a valid BST after performing_ `n - 1` _operations, or_ `null` _if it is impossible to create a valid BST_.

A BST (binary search tree) is a binary tree where each node satisfies the following property:

-   Every node in the node's left subtree has a value **strictly less** than the node's value.
-   Every node in the node's right subtree has a value **strictly greater** than the node's value.

A leaf is a node that has no children.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/08/d1.png)

```
Input: trees = [[2,1],[3,2,5],[5,4]]
Output: [3,2,5,1,null,4]
Explanation:
In the first operation, pick i=1 and j=0, and merge trees[0] into trees[1].
Delete trees[0], so trees = [[3,2,5,1],[5,4]].
```

```
In the second operation, pick i=0 and j=1, and merge trees[1] into trees[0].
Delete trees[1], so trees = [[3,2,5,1,null,4]].
```

```
The resulting tree, shown above, is a valid BST, so return its root.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/08/d2.png)

```
Input: trees = [[5,3,8],[3,2,6]]
Output: []
Explanation:
Pick i=0 and j=1 and merge trees[1] into trees[0].
Delete trees[1], so trees = [[5,3,8,2,6]].
```
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/24/diagram-3.png)
```
The resulting tree is shown above. This is the only valid operation that can be performed, but the resulting tree is not a valid BST, so return null.
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/08/d3.png)

```
Input: trees = [[5,4],[3]]
Output: []
Explanation: It is impossible to perform any operations.
```

**Constraints:**
-   `n == trees.length`
-   `1 <= n <= 5 * 104`
-   The number of nodes in each tree is in the range `[1, 3]`.
-   Each node in the input may have children but no grandchildren.
-   No two roots of `trees` have the same value.
-   All the trees in the input are **valid BSTs**.
-   `1 <= TreeNode.val <= 5 * 104`.

**Solution:**
- [x] [[Depth First Search]] 

**Intuition** :
This solution identifies the topmost root, and then traverses from it, joining leaves with matching roots.

1.  Populate a hashmap {value: root} . All root values are guaranteed to be unique.
2.  Count values among all trees.
3.  Identify a root of the combined tree; it's value must be counted only once.
4.  Traverse from the root:
    -   Check BST validity, like in [98. Validate Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/).
    -   Join leaves with roots, matching leaf and root value using the map.
5.  If the combined tree is valid, and it includes all roots - return the root of the combined tree.
