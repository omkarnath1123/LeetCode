Link: [1156. Swap For Longest Repeated Character Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-for-longest-repeated-character-substring/) <br>
Tag : **Medium**<br>
Lock: **Normal**

You are given a string `text`. You can swap two of the characters in the `text`.

Return _the length of the longest substring with repeated characters_.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: text = "ababa"
Output: 3
Explanation: We can swap the first 'b' with the last 'a', or the last 'b' with the first 'a'. Then, the longest repeated character substring is "aaa" with length 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: text = "aaabaaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Swap 'b' with the last 'a' (or the first 'a'), and we get longest repeated character substring "aaaaaa" with length 6.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: text = "aaaaa"
Output: 5
Explanation: No need to swap, longest repeated character substring is "aaaaa" with length is 5.
```

**Constraints:**
-   `1 <= text.length <= 2 * 104`
-   `text` consist of lowercase English characters only.

**Solution:**
- [x]  [[Sliding Window]] 

**Intuition** :
For each character `ch` within `a..z`, use the sliding window to detect the longest substring (with up to one different character).
Note that the result will be the minimum of the longest substring and the total number of characters `ch`, since we may not have an extra character to swap and close the gap.

```
n = is the length of text
```
**Time Complexity** : O(26*n)<br>
**Space Complexity** : O(1)

```java
    public int maxRepOpt1(String text) {
        
        Map<Character, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
        for (char ch : text.toCharArray())
            freq.merge(ch, 1, Integer::sum);
        
        int maxLenSub = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            char repeated = (char)(i + 'a');
            maxLenSub = Math.max(maxLenSub, 
                                 getMaxlength(text, freq.getOrDefault(repeated, 0), repeated));
        }
        return maxLenSub;
    }
    private int getMaxlength(String text, int total, char repeated) {
        
        int start = 0,
            maxLength = 0,
            len = text.length(),
            otherChar = 1;
        
        for (int end = 0; end < len; end++) {
            char ch = text.charAt(end);
            if (ch != repeated) otherChar--;
            
            while (otherChar < 0) {
                ch = text.charAt(start);
                if (ch != repeated) otherChar++;
                start++;
            }
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, end - start + 1);
        }
        return Math.min(maxLength, total);
    }
```
