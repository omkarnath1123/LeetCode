Tag : **Medium**<br>
Lock: **Premium**

You are given two strings of the same length `s1` and `s2` and a string `baseStr`.

We say `s1[i]` and `s2[i]` are equivalent characters.

-   For example, if `s1 = "abc"` and `s2 = "cde"`, then we have `'a' == 'c'`, `'b' == 'd'`, and `'c' == 'e'`.

Equivalent characters follow the usual rules of any equivalence relation:

-   **Reflexivity:** `'a' == 'a'`.
-   **Symmetry:** `'a' == 'b'` implies `'b' == 'a'`.
-   **Transitivity:** `'a' == 'b'` and `'b' == 'c'` implies `'a' == 'c'`.

For example, given the equivalency information from `s1 = "abc"` and `s2 = "cde"`, `"acd"` and `"aab"` are equivalent strings of `baseStr = "eed"`, and `"aab"` is the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of `baseStr`.

Return _the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of_ `baseStr` _by using the equivalency information from_ `s1` _and_ `s2`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s1 = "parker", s2 = "morris", baseStr = "parser"
Output: "makkek"
Explanation: Based on the equivalency information in s1 and s2, we can group their characters as [m,p], [a,o], [k,r,s], [e,i].
The characters in each group are equivalent and sorted in lexicographical order.
So the answer is "makkek".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s1 = "hello", s2 = "world", baseStr = "hold"
Output: "hdld"
Explanation: Based on the equivalency information in s1 and s2, we can group their characters as [h,w], [d,e,o], [l,r].
So only the second letter 'o' in baseStr is changed to 'd', the answer is "hdld".
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s1 = "leetcode", s2 = "programs", baseStr = "sourcecode"
Output: "aauaaaaada"
Explanation: We group the equivalent characters in s1 and s2 as [a,o,e,r,s,c], [l,p], [g,t] and [d,m], thus all letters in baseStr except 'u' and 'd' are transformed to 'a', the answer is "aauaaaaada".
```

**Constraints:**
-   `1 <= s1.length, s2.length, baseStr <= 1000`
-   `s1.length == s2.length`
-   `s1`, `s2`, and `baseStr` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Detailed Intuition

### How to Think About the Solution:
1. Think of it as finding connected components
2. Each component represents equivalent letters
3. Need to choose smallest letter in each group
4. Use Union-Find with optimization

### Key Insights:
1. Equivalence is transitive
2. Need to maintain letter groups
3. Each group needs a representative
4. Can optimize for lexicographic order

### Step-by-Step Approach:
1. **Building Groups**:
   - Process s1 and s2 character pairs
   - Union equivalent characters
   - Keep track of smallest char in group
   - Handle transitive relations

2. **String Transformation**:
   - For each char in baseStr:
     - Find its group
     - Use smallest char in group
     - Build result string

### Visual Guide:
```
Example: s1 = "parker", s2 = "morris"
baseStr = "parser"

Building equivalence groups:
p ↔ m  →  [m,p]
a ↔ o  →  [a,o]
r ↔ r  →  [r]
k ↔ r  →  [k,r]
e ↔ i  →  [e,i]
r ↔ s  →  [k,r,s]

Final groups:
[m,p], [a,o], [k,r,s], [e,i]

Transform "parser":
p → m (from [m,p])
a → a (from [a,o])
r → k (from [k,r,s])
s → k (from [k,r,s])
e → e (from [e,i])
r → k (from [k,r,s])

Result: "makkek"
```

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- Single character strings
- All characters equivalent
- No equivalent pairs
- Maximum length strings
- Cyclic equivalences

### Common Pitfalls:
1. Not handling transitivity
2. Wrong group representative
3. Missing equivalences
4. Inefficient group lookup

### Optimization Techniques:
1. **Union-Find Structure**:
   - Path compression
   - Union by rank
   - Keep smallest char

2. **Group Management**:
   - Efficient representative tracking
   - Quick character lookup
   - Minimize unions

### Time and Space Analysis:
- Time Complexity: O(N + M × α(26))
  - N = length of strings
  - M = transformations needed
  - α = inverse Ackermann function
- Space Complexity: O(1)
  - Fixed size for 26 letters

### Similar Problems:
- Sentence Similarity
- Account Merge
- Redundant Connection

### Implementation Tips:
1. Initialize Union-Find array
2. Track smallest char per group
3. Process pairs efficiently
4. Build result incrementally

**Solution:**

- [x] [[Union-Find]]

**Intuition** :
The key to solving this problem is modifying the `union` method to prefer the lexicographically smaller parent when combining `x` and `y`. This way, calling `find` on any character should return the smallest character in that connected component.

```
n = len of sOne 
m = len of baseStr 

**Time Complexity** : O(max(n, m))<br>
**Space Complexity** : O(1)

```java
    public String smallestEquivalentString(String sOne, String sTwo, String baseStr) {
        
        int len = sOne.length();
        DisjointSet set = new DisjointSet();
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++)
            set.union(sOne.charAt(i), sTwo.charAt(i));
        
        Map<Character, Character> lowestAlter = set.lowestAlternate();

            if (lowestAlter.containsKey(ch))
                sb.append(lowestAlter.get(ch));
            else
