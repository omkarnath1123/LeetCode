A **[binary expression tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_expression_tree)** is a kind of binary tree used to represent arithmetic expressions. Each node of a binary expression tree has either zero or two children. Leaf nodes (nodes with 0 children) correspond to operands (variables), and internal nodes (nodes with two children) correspond to the operators. In this problem, we only consider the `'+'` operator (i.e. addition).

You are given the roots of two binary expression trees, `root1` and `root2`. Return `true` _if the two binary expression trees are equivalent_. Otherwise, return `false`.

Two binary expression trees are equivalent if they **evaluate to the same value** regardless of what the variables are set to.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: root1 = [x], root2 = [x]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/04/tree1.png)**
```
Input: root1 = [+,a,+,null,null,b,c], root2 = [+,+,a,b,c]
Output: true
Explaination: a + (b + c) == (b + c) + a
```

**Example 3:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/04/tree2.png)**
```
Input: root1 = [+,a,+,null,null,b,c], root2 = [+,+,a,b,d]
Output: false
Explaination: a + (b + c) != (b + d) + a
```

**Constraints:**
-   The number of nodes in both trees are equal, odd and, in the range `[1, 4999]`.
-   `Node.val` is `'+'` or a lower-case English letter.
-   It's **guaranteed** that the tree given is a valid binary expression tree.

**Follow up:** What will you change in your solution if the tree also supports the `'-'` operator (i.e. subtraction)?

**Solution:**
- [x] [[Hash Table]]

**Intuition** :
Since the problem says given trees are valid expressions we only need to see that both trees have same elements as addition is associative and commutative i.e. (a+b)+c = (a+c)+b.  
We can easily check this equality by traversing the first tree in any order we like and recording the values in a map followed by traversing the second tree and taking values out from the map.
If there is any non zero residue in map we return false and true otherwise.

```
n = nodes in the tree
```
