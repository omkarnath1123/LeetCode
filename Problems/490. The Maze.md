Link: [490. The Maze](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-maze/) <br>
Tag : **Medium**<br>
Lock: **Premium**

There is a ball in a `maze` with empty spaces (represented as `0`) and walls (represented as `1`). The ball can go through the empty spaces by rolling **up, down, left or right**, but it won't stop rolling until hitting a wall. When the ball stops, it could choose the next direction.

Given the `m x n` `maze`, the ball's `start` position and the `destination`, where `start = [startrow, startcol]` and `destination = [destinationrow, destinationcol]`, return `true` if the ball can stop at the destination, otherwise return `false`.

You may assume that **the borders of the maze are all walls** (see examples).

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/31/maze1-1-grid.jpg)
```
Input: maze = [[0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,1,0],[1,1,0,1,1],[0,0,0,0,0]], start = [0,4], destination = [4,4]
Output: true
Explanation: One possible way is : left -> down -> left -> down -> right -> down -> right.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/31/maze1-2-grid.jpg)
```
Input: maze = [[0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,1,0],[1,1,0,1,1],[0,0,0,0,0]], start = [0,4], destination = [3,2]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no way for the ball to stop at the destination. Notice that you can pass through the destination but you cannot stop there.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: maze = [[0,0,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1],[0,1,0,0,0]], start = [4,3], destination = [0,1]
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**
-   `m == maze.length`
-   `n == maze[i].length`
-   `1 <= m, n <= 100`
-   `maze[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.
-   `start.length == 2`
-   `destination.length == 2`
-   `0 <= startrow, destinationrow <= m`
-   `0 <= startcol, destinationcol <= n`
-   Both the ball and the destination exist in an empty space, and they will not be in the same position initially.
-   The maze contains **at least 2 empty spaces**.

**Solution:**

**Intuition** :
In order to implement this, we make use of a queue. We start with the ball at the start position. For every current position, we add all the new positions possible by traversing in all the four directions(till reaching the wall or boundary) into the queue to act as the new start positions and mark these positions as True in the visited array. When all the directions have been covered up, we remove a position value, s, from the front of the queue and again continue the same process with s acting as the new start position.

Further, in order to choose the direction of travel, we make use of a dir array, which contains 4 entries. Each entry represents a one-dimensional direction of travel. To travel in a particular direction, we keep on adding the particular entry of the dirs array till we hit a wall or a boundary. For a particular start position, we do this process of dir addition for all all the four directions possible.

If we hit the destination position at any moment, we return a True directly indicating that the destination position can be reached starting from the start position.

m = len of maze
n = bre of maze
