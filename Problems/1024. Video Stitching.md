Lock: **Normal**

You are given a series of video clips from a sporting event that lasted `time` seconds. These video clips can be overlapping with each other and have varying lengths.

Each video clip is described by an array `clips` where `clips[i] = [starti, endi]` indicates that the ith clip started at `starti` and ended at `endi`.

We can cut these clips into segments freely.

-   For example, a clip `[0, 7]` can be cut into segments `[0, 1] + [1, 3] + [3, 7]`.

Return _the minimum number of clips needed so that we can cut the clips into segments that cover the entire sporting event_ `[0, time]`. If the task is impossible, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: clips = [[0,2],[4,6],[8,10],[1,9],[1,5],[5,9]], time = 10
Output: 3
Explanation: We take the clips [0,2], [8,10], [1,9]; a total of 3 clips.
Then, we can reconstruct the sporting event as follows:
We cut [1,9] into segments [1,2] + [2,8] + [8,9].
Now we have segments [0,2] + [2,8] + [8,10] which cover the sporting event [0, 10].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: clips = [[0,1],[1,2]], time = 5
Output: -1
Explanation: We cannot cover [0,5] with only [0,1] and [1,2].
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: clips = [[0,1],[6,8],[0,2],[5,6],[0,4],[0,3],[6,7],[1,3],[4,7],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6],[3,4],[4,5],[5,7],[6,9]], time = 9
Output: 3
Explanation: We can take clips [0,4], [4,7], and [6,9].
```

**Constraints:**
-   `1 <= clips.length <= 100`
-   `0 <= starti <= endi <= 100`
-   `1 <= time <= 100`

## Detailed Intuition

### 💡 How to Think About the Solution

1. **Video Coverage Concept:**
   - Think of it as filling a timeline [0, time]
   - Each clip can contribute partial coverage
   - Need to minimize number of clips used
   - Clips can overlap and be split

2. **Key Insights:**
   - Always pick clip that extends furthest
   - Must maintain continuous coverage
   - Track current covered position
   - Early clips affect later choices

### 🔍 Edge Cases to Consider
- No clips starting at 0
- Gaps in coverage
- Single clip covering everything
- All clips too short
- Overlapping clips
- Non-overlapping clips
- Maximum time (100)
- Maximum clips (100)
- Clips entirely outside [0,time]

### 🎯 Solution Approaches

1. **Greedy Approach**
   ```pseudo
   function videoStitching(clips, time):
       # Sort by start time, then by end time in reverse
       sort clips by (start, -end)
       
       currentEnd = 0  # Current coverage
       furthestEnd = 0 # Max possible extension
       count = 0
       i = 0
       
       while currentEnd < time:
           count += 1
           # Find clip that extends furthest
           while i < clips.length and clips[i][0] <= currentEnd:
               furthestEnd = max(furthestEnd, clips[i][1])
               i += 1
           
           if currentEnd == furthestEnd:
               return -1  # Cannot extend further
           
           currentEnd = furthestEnd
       
       return count
   ```
   Time: O(n log n), Space: O(1)

### 📈 Visual Explanation
```
Example: clips = [[0,2],[4,6],[8,10],[1,9],[1,5],[5,9]]
time = 10

Timeline visualization:
0     2     4     6     8     10
|-----|
      |-----------|
                  |-----|
|------------------------|
|-----------|
            |-----------|

Greedy selection:
1. [0,2]: Covers [0,2]
2. [1,9]: Extends to 9
3. [8,10]: Completes coverage

Result: 3 clips needed
```

### 🛠️ Implementation Tips
1. Sort clips for efficient processing
2. Track current and furthest reach
3. Process overlapping clips together
4. Handle gaps in coverage
5. Check for impossible cases early

### 📊 Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(n log n)
  - Sorting clips: O(n log n)
  - Processing clips: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
  - Only constant extra space needed

### 📝 Example Processing Flow
```
Input: [[0,2],[4,6],[8,10],[1,9],[1,5],[5,9]]
time = 10

Step 1: Current = 0
- Can use [0,2], [1,9]
- Pick [1,9] (extends furthest)
Count = 1

Step 2: Current = 9
- Can use [8,10]
- Must use it to reach 10
Count = 2

Final result: 2 clips
([1,9] and [8,10])
```

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. Not sorting clips properly
2. Missing gap detection
3. Incorrect greedy choice
4. Not handling overlaps efficiently
5. Wrong count of minimum clips

**Solution**

We sort our clips by the starting point. Since clips are sorted, we need to only analyze each clip once. For each round, we check all overlapping clips (`clips[i][0] <= st`) and advance our stitching position as far as we can (`end = max(end, clips[i][1])`).

Return `-1` if we cannot advance our stitching position (`st == end`).

n = the length of the string

            minHeap.add(new Clip(clip[0], clip[1]));
        
        int counter = 0,
            count = 0;
        while (!minHeap.isEmpty() && counter < time) {
            if (counter < minHeap.peek().start)
                return -1;
            else {
                int range = counter;
                while (!minHeap.isEmpty() && counter >= minHeap.peek().start) {
                    Clip poll = minHeap.poll();
                    range = Math.max(range, poll.end);
                }
                count++;
                counter = range;
            }
        }
        return counter < time ? -1 : count;
    }
    class Clip implements Comparable<Clip> {
        int start, end;
        Clip (int start, int end) {
            this.start = start;
            this.end = end;
        }
        @Override
        public int compareTo(Clip that) {
            if (this.start == that.start)
                return -1 * Integer.compare(this.end - this.start, 
                                       that.end - that.start);
            return Integer.compare(this.start, that.start);
        }
    }
```
