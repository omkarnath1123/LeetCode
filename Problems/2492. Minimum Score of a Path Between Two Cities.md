Link: [2492. Minimum Score of a Path Between Two Cities](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-score-of-a-path-between-two-cities/) <br>
Tag : **Medium**<br>
Lock: **Normal**

You are given a positive integer `n` representing `n` cities numbered from `1` to `n`. You are also given a **2D** array `roads` where `roads[i] = [ai, bi, distancei]` indicates that there is a **bidirectional** road between cities `ai` and `bi` with a distance equal to `distancei`. The cities graph is not necessarily connected.

The **score** of a path between two cities is defined as the **minimum** distance of a road in this path.

Return _the **minimum** possible score of a path between cities_ `1` _and_ `n`.

**Note**:

- A path is a sequence of roads between two cities.
- It is allowed for a path to contain the same road **multiple** times, and you can visit cities `1` and `n` multiple times along the path.
- The test cases are generated such that there is **at least** one path between `1` and `n`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/10/12/graph11.png)

```
Input: n = 4, roads = [[1,2,9],[2,3,6],[2,4,5],[1,4,7]]
Output: 5
Explanation: The path from city 1 to 4 with the minimum score is: 1 -> 2 -> 4. The score of this path is min(9,5) = 5.
It can be shown that no other path has less score.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/10/12/graph22.png)

```
Input: n = 4, roads = [[1,2,2],[1,3,4],[3,4,7]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The path from city 1 to 4 with the minimum score is: 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4. The score of this path is min(2,2,4,7) = 2.
```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 105`
- `1 <= roads.length <= 105`
- `roads[i].length == 3`
- `1 <= ai, bi <= n`
- `ai != bi`
- `1 <= distancei <= 104`
- There are no repeated edges.
- There is at least one path between `1` and `n`.

**Solution:**

- [x]  [[Union-Find]]

**Intuition** :

It is guaranteed in the problem that nodes `1` and `n` belong to the connected component of `1`. Any of its edges can be included in the path between `1` and `n`, because the graph is bidirectional and we can visit nodes multiple times (i.e., go back to the visited nodes). Thus, all we have to do is find the edge with minimal weight in the connected component of `1`.

n = no. of cities
e = no. of roads
