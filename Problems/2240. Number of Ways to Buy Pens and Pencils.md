You are given an integer `total` indicating the amount of money you have. You are also given two integers `cost1` and `cost2` indicating the price of a pen and pencil respectively. You can spend **part or all** of your money to buy multiple quantities (or none) of each kind of writing utensil.

Return _the **number of distinct ways** you can buy some number of pens and pencils._

**Example 1:**
```
Input: total = 20, cost1 = 10, cost2 = 5
Output: 9
Explanation: The price of a pen is 10 and the price of a pencil is 5.
- If you buy 0 pens, you can buy 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 pencils.
- If you buy 1 pen, you can buy 0, 1, or 2 pencils.
- If you buy 2 pens, you cannot buy any pencils.
The total number of ways to buy pens and pencils is 5 + 3 + 1 = 9.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: total = 5, cost1 = 10, cost2 = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: The price of both pens and pencils are 10, which cost more than total, so you cannot buy any writing utensils. Therefore, there is only 1 way: buy 0 pens and 0 pencils.
```

**Constraints:**
-   `1 <= total, cost1, cost2 <= 106`

**Solution:**
- [x] [[Math]]

**Intuition** :
If we buy `cnt` pens, we can buy up to `(total - cnt * cost1) / cost2 + 1` pencils. We do plus one as we can also buy zero pencils.

```
n = total
```
**Time Complexity** : O(n)<br>
**Space Complexity** : O(1)

```java
    public long waysToBuyPensPencils(int total, int penCost, int pencilCost) {
        
        long comb = 0;
        for (long i = 0; i * penCost <= total; i++)
            comb += (total - penCost * i) / pencilCost + 1L;
        return comb;
    }
```
