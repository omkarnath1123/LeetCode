Link: [583. Delete Operation for Two Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-operation-for-two-strings/) <br>
Tag : **Medium**<br>
Lock: **Normal**

Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return _the minimum number of **steps** required to make_ `word1` _and_ `word2` _the same_.

In one **step**, you can delete exactly one character in either string.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: word1 = "sea", word2 = "eat"
Output: 2
Explanation: You need one step to make "sea" to "ea" and another step to make "eat" to "ea".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: word1 = "leetcode", word2 = "etco"
Output: 4
```

**Constraints:**
-   `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500`
-   `word1` and `word2` consist of only lowercase English letters.


**Solution:**
- [x] [[Dynamic Programming]] + [[Bottom-Up Solution]]

**Intuition** :
To make them identical, just find the longest common subsequence. The rest of the characters have to be deleted from the both the strings, which does not belong to longest common subsequence.

```
n = length of one
m = length of two
```
**Time Complexity** : O(n*m)<br>
**Space Complexity** : O(n*m)

```java
    public int minDistance(String one, String two) {
        
        int len = one.length(), bre = two.length();
        int[][] store = new int[len + 1][bre + 1];
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= len; i++)
            for (int j = 1; j <= bre; j++)
                if (one.charAt(i - 1) == two.charAt(j - 1))
                    store[i][j] = store[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                else
                    store[i][j] = Math.max(store[i - 1][j], store[i][j - 1]);
        
        return len + bre - 2 * store[len][bre];
    }
```
