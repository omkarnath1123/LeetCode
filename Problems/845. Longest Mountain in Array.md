Link: [845. Longest Mountain in Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-mountain-in-array/) <br>
Tag : **Medium**<br>
Lock: **Normal**

You may recall that an array `arr` is a **mountain array** if and only if:

-   `arr.length >= 3`
-   There exists some index `i` (**0-indexed**) with `0 < i < arr.length - 1` such that:
    -   `arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]`
    -   `arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]`

Given an integer array `arr`, return _the length of the longest subarray, which is a mountain_. Return `0` if there is no mountain subarray.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: arr = [2,1,4,7,3,2,5]
Output: 5
Explanation: The largest mountain is [1,4,7,3,2] which has length 5.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: arr = [2,2,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no mountain.
```

**Constraints:**
-   `1 <= arr.length <= 104`
-   `0 <= arr[i] <= 104`

**Follow up:**
-   Can you solve it using only one pass?
-   Can you solve it in `O(1)` space?

**Solution:**

- [x] [[Greedy]]

**Intuition** :
In this problem, we take one forward pass to count up hill length (to every point).  
We take another backward pass to count down hill length (from every point).  
Finally a pass to find max(up[i] + down[i] + 1) where up[i] and down[i] should be positives.

```
n = is the length of the nums
```
**Time Complexity** : O(n)<br>
**Space Complexity** : O(1)

```java
    public int longestMountain(int[] arr) {
        
        int len = arr.length;
        int[] leftToRight = new int[len],
              rightToLeft = new int[len];
        for (int i = 1; i < len; i++)
            if (arr[i - 1] < arr[i])
                leftToRight[i] = leftToRight[i - 1] + 1;
        
        for (int i = len - 2; i >= 0; i--)
            if (arr[i + 1] < arr[i])
                rightToLeft[i] = rightToLeft[i + 1] + 1;
        
        int mountain = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < len - 1; i++)
            if (leftToRight[i] > 0 && rightToLeft[i] > 0)
                mountain = Math.max(mountain, 
                                    leftToRight[i] + rightToLeft[i] + 1);
        return mountain;
    }
```
