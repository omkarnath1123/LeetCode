An **ugly number** is a positive integer that is divisible by `a`, `b`, or `c`.

Given four integers `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, return the `nth` **ugly number**.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 3, a = 2, b = 3, c = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: The ugly numbers are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10... The 3rd is 4.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 4, a = 2, b = 3, c = 4
Output: 6
Explanation: The ugly numbers are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12... The 4th is 6.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: n = 5, a = 2, b = 11, c = 13
Output: 10
Explanation: The ugly numbers are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13... The 5th is 10.
```

**Constraints:**
-   `1 <= n, a, b, c <= 109`
-   `1 <= a * b * c <= 1018`
-   It is guaranteed that the result will be in range `[1, 2 * 109]`.


**Solution:**

- [x] [[Binary Search]] + [[Greedy]]

**Intuition** :
For every integer N, `F(N) = (total number of positive integers <= N which are divisible by a or b or c.).`

`The left-top circle stands for numbers <= N that are divisible by a`  
others the same idea, and the intersection of two/three circles is the total number of positive integers <= N which are divisible by the`least common multiple` of them.  
`F(N) = a + b + c - a ∩ c - a ∩ b - b ∩ c + a ∩ b ∩ c`  
`F(N) = N/a + N/b + N/c - N/lcm(a, c) - N/lcm(a, b) - N/lcm(b, c) + N/lcm(a, b, c)`(lcm = least common multiple)  
Find the least integer `N` that satisfies the condition `F(N) >= K`

```java
    int max = 2 * (int) Math.pow(10, 9);

            result = 0;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if ((int) count(mid, one, two, three) >= n) {
                result = mid;
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
    private long count(int num, int one, int two, int three) {
        return num / one + num / two + num / three
            - num / lcm(one, two) +
            - num / lcm(two, three) + 
            - num / lcm(three, one) + 
            + num / lcm(one, lcm(two, three));
    }

        if (two == 0) return one;
        return gcd(two, one % two);
    }
    private long lcm(long one, long two) {
        return one * two / gcd(one, two);
    }
