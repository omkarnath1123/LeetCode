Link: [1135. Connecting Cities With Minimum Cost](https://leetcode.com/problems/connecting-cities-with-minimum-cost/) <br>
Tag : **Medium**<br>
Lock: **Premium**

There are `n` cities labeled from `1` to `n`. You are given the integer `n` and an array `connections` where `connections[i] = [xi, yi, costi]` indicates that the cost of connecting city `xi` and city `yi` (bidirectional connection) is `costi`.

Return _the minimum **cost** to connect all the_ `n` _cities such that there is at least one path between each pair of cities_. If it is impossible to connect all the `n` cities, return `-1`,

The **cost** is the sum of the connections' costs used.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/04/20/1314_ex2.png)
```
Input: n = 3, connections = [[1,2,5],[1,3,6],[2,3,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation: Choosing any 2 edges will connect all cities so we choose the minimum 2.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/04/20/1314_ex1.png)
```
Input: n = 4, connections = [[1,2,3],[3,4,4]]
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no way to connect all cities even if all edges are used.
```

**Constraints:**
-   `1 <= n <= 104`
-   `1 <= connections.length <= 104`
-   `connections[i].length == 3`
-   `1 <= xi, yi <= n`
-   `xi != yi`
-   `0 <= costi <= 105`

**Solution:**
- [x] [[Union-Find]] 

**Intuition** :
We use Kruskalâ€™s algorithm to generate a minimum spanning tree for the graph. Use Union-Find to detect cycle.

Idea is simple:

1.  Sort edges to no-descresing order
2.  Pick the smallest edge that does not form a cycle
3.  Repeat until MST is formed and every node is connected.

Implemented Union-Find with path compression to improve efficiency.

```
e = edges in the graph
n = nodes in the graph
```
**Time Complexity** : O(e log(e))<br>
**Space Complexity** : O(n)
