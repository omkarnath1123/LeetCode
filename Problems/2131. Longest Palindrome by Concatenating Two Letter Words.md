Lock: **Normal**

You are given an array of strings `words`. Each element of `words` consists of **two** lowercase English letters.

Create the **longest possible palindrome** by selecting some elements from `words` and concatenating them in **any order**. Each element can be selected **at most once**.

Return _the **length** of the longest palindrome that you can create_. If it is impossible to create any palindrome, return `0`.

A **palindrome** is a string that reads the same forward and backward.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: words = ["lc","cl","gg"]
Output: 6
Explanation: One longest palindrome is "lc" + "gg" + "cl" = "lcggcl", of length 6.
Note that "clgglc" is another longest palindrome that can be created.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: words = ["ab","ty","yt","lc","cl","ab"]
Output: 8
Explanation: One longest palindrome is "ty" + "lc" + "cl" + "yt" = "tylcclyt", of length 8.
Note that "lcyttycl" is another longest palindrome that can be created.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: words = ["cc","ll","xx"]
Output: 2
Explanation: One longest palindrome is "cc", of length 2.
Note that "ll" is another longest palindrome that can be created, and so is "xx".
```

**Constraints:**
-   `1 <= words.length <= 105`
-   `words[i].length == 2`
-   `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

**Solution:**
- [x] [[Greedy]] + [[Hash Table]]

**Intuition** :
1.  In order to build a palindrome from given input, we can start from the center to construct one;
2.  There are `2` possibilites for the center of the palindrome:  
    a empty string;  
    a palindromic word, which implies `word[0] == word[1]`;
3.  According to the problem, each word is allowed to use at most once; Also, we only need the length of the longest palindrome.

Therefore, we can use `HashMap/dict` to save non-paired words and try to pair the words during traversal; Once find a counter-part for current word, remove it from the `HashMap/dict`, increase the `pairs` counter and update the count of the symmitric words accordingly.

```
n = is the no. of words

**Time Complexity** : O(n)<br>
**Space Complexity** : O(n)

```java
    public int longestPalindrome(String[] words) {
        
        int len = 0;
        Map<String, Integer> store = new HashMap<>();
        for (String word : words) {
            String reverse = new StringBuilder(word).reverse().toString();
            if (store.containsKey(reverse)) {
                store.merge(reverse, -1, Integer::sum);
                if (store.get(reverse) == 0) store.remove(reverse);
                len += 4;
            } else 
                store.merge(word, 1, Integer::sum);
        }
        
        for (String remain : store.keySet())
            if (remain.charAt(0) == remain.charAt(1)) {
                len += 2;
                break;
            }
        return len;
    }
```
