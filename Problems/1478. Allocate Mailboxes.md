Tag : **Hard**<br>
Lock: **Normal**

Given the array `houses` where `houses[i]` is the location of the `ith` house along a street and an integer `k`, allocate `k` mailboxes in the street.

Return _the **minimum** total distance between each house and its nearest mailbox_.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/05/07/sample_11_1816.png)
```
Input: houses = [1,4,8,10,20], k = 3
Output: 5
Explanation: Allocate mailboxes in position 3, 9 and 20.
Minimum total distance from each houses to nearest mailboxes is |3-1| + |4-3| + |9-8| + |10-9| + |20-20| = 5 
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/05/07/sample_2_1816.png)
```
Input: houses = [2,3,5,12,18], k = 2
Output: 9
Explanation: Allocate mailboxes in position 3 and 14.
Minimum total distance from each houses to nearest mailboxes is |2-3| + |3-3| + |5-3| + |12-14| + |18-14| = 9.
```

**Constraints:**
-   `1 <= k <= houses.length <= 100`
-   `1 <= houses[i] <= 104`
-   All the integers of `houses` are **unique**.


**Solution:**

- [x] [[Utils/Dynamic Programming]] + [[Top-Down Solution]]

**Intuition** :
-   The idea is we try to allocate each mailbox to `k` group of the consecutive houses `houses[i:j]`. We found a solution if we can distribute total `k` mailboxes to `n` houses devided into `k` groups `[0..i], [i+1..j], ..., [l..n-1]`.
-   After all, we choose the **minimum cost** among our solutions.
- Let `costs[i][j]` is the total travel distance from houses `houses[i:j]` to a mailbox when putting the mailbox among `houses[i:j]`, the best way is put the mail box at **median position** among `houses[i:j]`

            minCost = Math.min(minCost, 
                               cost[index][i] + getCost(houses, houseCount, mailbox - 1, i + 1));
        store[index][mailbox] = minCost;
        return minCost;
    }
