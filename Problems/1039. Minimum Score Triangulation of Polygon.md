Tag : **Medium**<br>
Lock: **Normal**

You have a convex `n`-sided polygon where each vertex has an integer value. You are given an integer array `values` where `values[i]` is the value of the `ith` vertex (i.e., **clockwise order**).

You will **triangulate** the polygon into `n - 2` triangles. For each triangle, the value of that triangle is the product of the values of its vertices, and the total score of the triangulation is the sum of these values over all `n - 2` triangles in the triangulation.

Return _the smallest possible total score that you can achieve with some triangulation of the polygon_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/25/shape1.jpg)

```
Input: values = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The polygon is already triangulated, and the score of the only triangle is 6.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/25/shape2.jpg)

```
Input: values = [3,7,4,5]
Output: 144
Explanation: There are two triangulations, with possible scores: 3*7*5 + 4*5*7 = 245, or 3*4*5 + 3*4*7 = 144.
The minimum score is 144.
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/25/shape3.jpg)

```
Input: values = [1,3,1,4,1,5]
Output: 13
Explanation: The minimum score triangulation has score 1*1*3 + 1*1*4 + 1*1*5 + 1*1*1 = 13.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `n == values.length`
-   `3 <= n <= 50`
-   `1 <= values[i] <= 100`

## Detailed Intuition

### 💡 How to Think About the Solution

1. **Understanding Triangulation:**
   - A triangulation divides a polygon into triangles using non-intersecting diagonals
   - For an n-sided polygon, we need exactly (n-2) triangles
   - Each triangle's score is the product of its vertex values
   - We want to minimize the sum of all triangle scores

2. **Key Insights:**
   - We can break this down into subproblems
   - Any diagonal divides the polygon into two parts
   - Each part can be triangulated independently
   - The final answer builds up from smaller polygons

### 🔍 Edge Cases to Consider
- Minimum polygon (3 vertices)
- Maximum polygon (50 vertices)
- All values being the same
- Large differences between adjacent values
- Values near the constraints (1 to 100)

### 🎯 Solution Approaches

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**
   ```pseudo
   // dp[i][j] represents minimum score for polygon from vertex i to j
   for len from 3 to n:
       for i from 0 to n-len:
           j = i + len - 1
           dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + values[i]*values[k]*values[j])
                      for all k from i+1 to j-1
   ```
   Time: O(n³), Space: O(n²)

### 📈 Visual Explanation
```
For polygon [3,7,4,5]:

Step 1: Base triangles (size 3)
[3,7,4]: min score = 3*7*4 = 84
[7,4,5]: min score = 7*4*5 = 140
...

Step 2: Full polygon
Choice 1: (3,7,5) + (3,4,5) = 105 + 60 = 165
Choice 2: (3,4,5) + (3,4,7) = 60 + 84 = 144 ← Minimum!
```

### 🛠️ Implementation Tips
1. Use 2D DP table to store minimum scores
2. Process subpolygons from smaller to larger sizes
3. Consider all possible ways to split each subpolygon
4. Initialize base cases properly (triangles of size 3)

### 📊 Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(n³) 
  - For each length (n)
  - For each starting point (n)
  - For each splitting point (n)
- Space Complexity: O(n²)
  - 2D DP table storing results for all subpolygons

### 🎨 Visualization Aid
![Polygon Triangulation](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/25/shape2.jpg)
*The image shows two possible triangulations. We need to find the one with minimum score.*
2. Think of it as choosing which vertices to connect to form triangles
3. Each triangle division creates subproblems of smaller polygons

### Key Insights:
1. For n vertices, we need exactly (n-2) triangles
2. Any triangulation must use adjacent vertices
3. We can break down the problem by choosing a base edge and finding the best vertex to connect it to

### Step-by-Step Approach:
1. **Base Cases**:
   - If we have < 3 vertices, score is 0
   - If we have exactly 3 vertices, only one possible triangle

2. **For larger polygons**:
   - Fix two points i and j
   - Try all points k between them to form a triangle
   - The polygon is split into two parts that can be solved independently

### Visual Guide:
```
For values = [3,7,4,5]

Possible triangulations:
1)      3 -------- 7
        |        / |
        |     /    |
        |  /       |
        4 -------- 5

2)      3 -------- 7
        | \        |
        |    \     |
        |       \  |
        4 -------- 5

DP formula:
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + values[i]*values[k]*values[j])
           for all k between i and j
```

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- Minimum polygon (3 vertices)
- Large polygons (close to 50 vertices)
- All values being the same
- Very different values (1 vs 100)

### Common Pitfalls:
1. Not considering all possible triangulations
2. Incorrect base cases
3. Forgetting to include the current triangle's score
4. Not handling adjacent vertices properly

### Optimization Techniques:
1. **Memoization**:
   - Store results of subproblems
   - Avoid recalculating same polygon sections
   
2. **State Representation**:
   - Use dp[i][j] to represent minimum score for polygon from vertex i to j

### Time and Space Analysis:
- Time Complexity: O(n³) - three nested loops
- Space Complexity: O(n²) - dp table size

### Real-world Applications:
- Computer Graphics (mesh triangulation)
- Computational Geometry
- 3D Modeling

If we pick a side of our polygon, it can form `n - 2` triangles. Each such triangle breaks our polygon into 2 sub-polygons. We can analyze `n - 2` triangles, and get the minimum score for sub-polygons using the recursion.  
![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/votrubac/image_1557470819.png)  
This is how this procedure looks for a sub-polygon (filled with diagonal pattern above).

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/votrubac/image_1557471328.png)

• Fix one side of the polygon i, j and move k within (i, j).  
• Calculate score of the i, k, j "orange" triangle.  
• Add the score of the "green" polygon i, k using recursion.  
• Add the score of the "blue" polygon k, j using recursion.  
• Use memoisation to remember minimum scores for each sub-polygons.

n == n-sided polygon where each vertex has an integer value.

**Time Complexity** : O(n<sup>3</sup>)<br>
**Space Complexity** : O(n<sup>2</sup>)

```java
    Integer[][] store;
    int len;
    public int minScoreTriangulation(int[] values) {
        store = new Integer[50][50];
        len = values.length;
        
        return backTrack(0, len - 1, values);
    }
    private int backTrack(int i, int j, int[] values) {
        if (j <= i + 1) return 0;// need three points to create the triangle 
        if (store[i][j] != null)
            return store[i][j];
        
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int k = i + 1; k < j; k++)
            min = Math.min(min, backTrack(i, k, values) + 
                                backTrack(k, j, values) + 
                                values[i] * values[j] * values[k]);
        store[i][j] = min;
        return min;
    }
```

- [x] [[Utils/Dynamic Programming]] + [[Bottom-Up Solution]]


**Intuition** :
At this point, it should not be hard to come up with a bottom-up solution. The only trick here is to move `i` backward. This ensures "green" and "blue" sub-polygons are processed before calculating min value for the entire polygon. It happens this way naturally with the recursive solution.

        for (int i = len - 1; i >= 0; i--)
            for (int j = i + 1; j < len; j++) {
                if (j <= i + 1) continue;
                
                int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
                for (int k = i + 1; k < j; k++) {
                    min = Math.min(min, values[i] * values[j] * values[k] + 
                                        store[i][k] + store[k][j]);
                }
                store[i][j] = min;
            }
        return store[0][len - 1];
    }
```
