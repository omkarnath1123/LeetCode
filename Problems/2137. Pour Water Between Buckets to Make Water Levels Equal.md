Link: [2137. Pour Water Between Buckets to Make Water Levels Equal](https://leetcode.com/problems/pour-water-between-buckets-to-make-water-levels-equal/) <br>
Tag : **Medium**<br>
Lock: **Premium**

You have `n` buckets each containing some gallons of water in it, represented by a **0-indexed** integer array `buckets`, where the `ith` bucket contains `buckets[i]` gallons of water. You are also given an integer `loss`.

You want to make the amount of water in each bucket equal. You can pour any amount of water from one bucket to another bucket (not necessarily an integer). However, every time you pour `k` gallons of water, you spill `loss` **percent** of `k`.

Return _the **maximum** amount of water in each bucket after making the amount of water equal._ Answers within `10-5` of the actual answer will be accepted.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: buckets = [1,2,7], loss = 80
Output: 2.00000
Explanation: Pour 5 gallons of water from buckets[2] to buckets[0].
5 * 80% = 4 gallons are spilled and buckets[0] only receives 5 - 4 = 1 gallon of water.
All buckets have 2 gallons of water in them so return 2.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: buckets = [2,4,6], loss = 50
Output: 3.50000
Explanation: Pour 0.5 gallons of water from buckets[1] to buckets[0].
0.5 * 50% = 0.25 gallons are spilled and buckets[0] only receives 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 gallons of water.
Now, buckets = [2.25, 3.5, 6].
Pour 2.5 gallons of water from buckets[2] to buckets[0].
2.5 * 50% = 1.25 gallons are spilled and buckets[0] only receives 2.5 - 1.25 = 1.25 gallons of water.
All buckets have 3.5 gallons of water in them so return 3.5.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: buckets = [3,3,3,3], loss = 40
Output: 3.00000
Explanation: All buckets already have the same amount of water in them.
```

**Constraints:**
-   `1 <= buckets.length <= 105`
-   `0 <= buckets[i] <= 105`
-   `0 <= loss <= 99`

**Solution:**
- [x] [[Binary Search]]

**Intuition** :
Let `a0, a1, ..., a(n-1)` be the input water gallons, and assume they are **sorted**.  
Let `t` be the final result - amount of water in each bucket after water equalising.  
Let `1 <= k <= n-1` so that all numbers in `[a0, a(k-1)]` are smaller than `t`, and `[a(k), a(n-1)]` equal or bigger than `t`. (Basically water are poured from buckets `k, ..., n-1` to buckets `0, ..., k-1`.)  
Let `loss in [0, 1]` be the loss.

Then the total amount of poured water can be represented in below two ways, and they should be **equal**.

1.  `(a(k) - t) + (a(k+1) - t) + ... + (a(n-1) - t)`
2.  `( (t - a0) + (t - a1) + ... + (t - a(k-1)) ) / (1-loss)`

With some math derivation, we can get the below formula for `t`:  
`t = ((a0 + ... + a(k-1)) + (1 - loss)(a(k) + ... + a(n - 1))) / (k + (1 - loss)(n - k))`

Apparently it is a function of `k`, so we just need to traverse the input array, and get the max result.

            minLevel = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int water : buckets) {
            maxLevel = Math.max(maxLevel, water);
            minLevel = Math.min(minLevel, water);
        }

        }
        return prev;

        for (int i = buckets.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            double water = buckets[i];
            if (water >= waterLevel) {
                spareWater += (1D - loss) * (water - waterLevel);
            } else {
                double waterNeeded = waterLevel - water;
                if (waterNeeded > spareWater) return false;
                spareWater -= waterNeeded;
            }
        }
        return true;
