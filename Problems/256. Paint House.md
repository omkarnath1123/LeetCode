Link: [256. Paint House](https://leetcode.com/problems/paint-house/) <br>
Tag : **Medium**<br>
Lock: **Premium**

There is a row of `n` houses, where each house can be painted one of three colors: red, blue, or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by an `n x 3` cost matrix `costs`.

-   For example, `costs[0][0]` is the cost of painting house `0` with the color red; `costs[1][2]` is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on...

Return _the minimum cost to paint all houses_.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: costs = [[17,2,17],[16,16,5],[14,3,19]]
Output: 10
Explanation: Paint house 0 into blue, paint house 1 into green, paint house 2 into blue.
Minimum cost: 2 + 5 + 3 = 10.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: costs = [[7,6,2]]
Output: 2
```

**Constraints:**
-   `costs.length == n`
-   `costs[i].length == 3`
-   `1 <= n <= 100`
-   `1 <= costs[i][j] <= 20`


**Solution:**

- [x] [[Dynamic Programming]] + [[Bottom-Up Solution]]

**Intuition** :
However, we don't need to look at the entire previous row for every cell. Let's look again at the large example from above. When we're calculating the values for the second row, we're adding the minimum from the first row onto them. The only cell we can't do this for is the one that was _directly below the minimum_, as this would break the adjacency rule. For this one, it makes sense to add the second minimum.
