Given an array of **unique** strings `words`, return _all the_ **[word squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_square)** _you can build from_ `words`. The same word from `words` can be used **multiple times**. You can return the answer in **any order**.

A sequence of strings forms a valid **word square** if the `kth` row and column read the same string, where `0 <= k < max(numRows, numColumns)`.

-   For example, the word sequence `["ball","area","lead","lady"]` forms a word square because each word reads the same both horizontally and vertically.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: words = ["area","lead","wall","lady","ball"]
Output: [["ball","area","lead","lady"],["wall","area","lead","lady"]]
Explanation:
The output consists of two word squares. The order of output does not matter (just the order of words in each word square matters).
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: words = ["abat","baba","atan","atal"]
Output: [["baba","abat","baba","atal"],["baba","abat","baba","atan"]]
Explanation:
The output consists of two word squares. The order of output does not matter (just the order of words in each word square matters).
```

**Constraints:**
-   `1 <= words.length <= 1000`
-   `1 <= words[i].length <= 4`
-   All `words[i]` have the same length.
-   `words[i]` consists of only lowercase English letters.
-   All `words[i]` are **unique**.

**Solution:**
- [x] [[Backtracking]] 

**Intuition** :
Given a list of words, we are asked to find a combination of words upon with we could construct a _word square_. The backbone of the algorithm to solve the above problem could be surprisingly simple.

> The idea is that we construct the word square **_row by row_** from top to down. At each row, we simply do _trial and error_, _i.e._ we try with one word, if it does not meet the constraint then we try another one.

As one might notice, the above idea of the algorithm is actually known as [backtracking](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/recursion-ii/472/backtracking/2654/), which is often associated with _recursion_ and _DFS_ (Depth-First Search) as well.

Let us illustrate the idea with an example. Given a list of words `[ball, able, area, lead, lady]`, we should pile up 4 words together in order to build a word square.

-   Let us start with the word `ball` as the first word in the word square, _i.e._ the word that we would put in the first row.
-   We then move on to the second row. Given the _symmetric_ property of the word square, we now know the letters that we should fill on the first _column_ of the second row. In other words, we know that the word in the second row should start with the _prefix_ `a`.
-   Among the list of words, there are two words with prefix `a` (_i.e._ `able`, `area`). Both of them could be the candidates to fill the second row of the square. We then should try both of them in the next step.
-   In the next step (1), let us fill the second row with the word `able`. Then we could move on to the third row. Again, due to the symmetric property, we know that the word in the third row should start with the prefix `ll`. Unfortunately, we do not find any word start with `ll`. As a result, we could no longer move forwards. We then abandon this path, and **_backtrack_** to the previous state (with the first row filled).
-   As an alternative next step (1), we could try with the word `area` in the second row. Once we fill the second row, we would know that in the next row, the word to be filled should start with the prefix `le`. And this time, we find the candidate (_i.e._ `lead`).
-   As a result, in the next step (2), we fill the third row with the word `lead`. So on and so forth.
-   _At the end, if one repeats the above steps with each word as the starting word, one would exhaust all the possibilities to construct a valid word square_.

            for (int i = 0; i <= word.length(); i++)
                prefix.computeIfAbsent(word.substring(0, i), item -> new LinkedList<>())
                      .add(word);
