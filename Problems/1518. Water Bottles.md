Lock: **Normal**

There are `numBottles` water bottles that are initially full of water. You can exchange `numExchange` empty water bottles from the market with one full water bottle.

The operation of drinking a full water bottle turns it into an empty bottle.

Given the two integers `numBottles` and `numExchange`, return _the **maximum** number of water bottles you can drink_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/01/sample_1_1875.png)

```
Input: numBottles = 9, numExchange = 3
Output: 13
Explanation: You can exchange 3 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle.
Number of water bottles you can drink: 9 + 3 + 1 = 13.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/01/sample_2_1875.png)

```
Input: numBottles = 15, numExchange = 4
Output: 19
Explanation: You can exchange 4 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle. 
Number of water bottles you can drink: 15 + 3 + 1 = 19.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= numBottles <= 100`
- `2 <= numExchange <= 100`

**Solution:**

- [x] [[Math]]

## Detailed Intuition

- After drinking b bottles, we have b empty bottles
- Each exchange requires n empty bottles and gives us 1 full bottle
- After drinking that bottle, we get 1 empty back
- Net cost per exchange: n−1 empty bottles

**Time Complexity** : O(n)<br>
**Space Complexity** : O(1)

```java
    public int numWaterBottles(int numBottles, int numExchange) {
        
        int fullBottels = numBottles,
            emptyBottels = numBottles;
        
        while (emptyBottels >= numExchange) {
            int newFullBottels = emptyBottels / numExchange;
            int remaingEmpty = emptyBottels % numExchange;

            fullBottels = fullBottels + newFullBottels;
            emptyBottels = newFullBottels + remaingEmpty;
        }
        return fullBottels;
    }
```
