A **[binary expression tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_expression_tree)** is a kind of binary tree used to represent arithmetic expressions. Each node of a binary expression tree has either zero or two children. Leaf nodes (nodes with 0 children) correspond to operands (numbers), and internal nodes (nodes with 2 children) correspond to the operators `'+'` (addition), `'-'` (subtraction), `'*'` (multiplication), and `'/'` (division).

For each internal node with operator `o`, the [**infix expression**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation) that it represents is `(A o B)`, where `A` is the expression the left subtree represents and `B` is the expression the right subtree represents.

You are given a string `s`, an **infix expression** containing operands, the operators described above, and parentheses `'('` and `')'`.

Return _any valid **binary expression tree**, which its **[in-order traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#In-order_(LNR))** reproduces_ `s` after omitting the parenthesis from it (see examples below)_._

**Please note that order of operations applies in** `s`**.** That is, expressions in parentheses are evaluated first, and multiplication and division happen before addition and subtraction.

Operands must also appear in the **same order** in both `s` and the in-order traversal of the tree.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/02/ex1-4.png)
```
Input: s = "3*4-2*5"
Output: [-,*,*,3,4,2,5]
Explanation: The tree above is the only valid tree whose inorder traversal produces s.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/02/ex1-2.png)
```
Input: s = "2-3/(5*2)+1"
Output: [+,-,1,2,/,null,null,null,null,3,*,null,null,5,2]
Explanation: The inorder traversal of the tree above is 2-3/5*2+1 which is the same as s without the parenthesis. The tree also produces the correct result and its operands are in the same order as they appear in s.
The tree below is also a valid binary expression tree with the same inorder traversal as s, but it not a valid answer because it does not evaluate to the same value.
```

```
The third tree below is also not valid. Although it produces the same result and is equivalent to the above trees, its inorder traversal does not produce s and its operands are not in the same order as s.

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "1+2+3+4+5"
Output: [+,+,5,+,4,null,null,+,3,null,null,1,2]
Explanation: The tree [+,+,5,+,+,null,null,1,2,3,4] is also one of many other valid trees.
```

**Constraints:**
-   `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
-   `s` consists of digits and the characters `'+'`, `'-'`, `'*'`, and `'/'`.
-   Operands in `s` are **exactly** 1 digit.
-   It is guaranteed that `s` is a valid expression.

**Solution:**
- [x] [[Stack]] 

**Intuition** :

-   adding a pair of parenthesis around the given string, which ensures that stack will end up having a single node (the result)
-   we look back to see if we can **combine** some nodes whenever we meet an operand (`+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`) or a closing parenthsis `)`
    -   if the current char is `*` or `/`, we can combine the previous 2 numbers **only if** the previous char is a `*` or `/`.
        -   Why? Think about `2+3*5`, when we are at `*`, the previous 2 numbers cannot be combined, because we have to wait `3*5` to be executed first
    -   if the current char is `+`, `-` or `)`, we need to use `while` loop to combine all adjacent nodes backward until hitting an openning parenthesis `(`
        -   Why? Think about `2+3*5+2`, when we are at the 2nd `+`, we first combine `3` and `5`, but we cannot stop there, we have to continue to combine `2+(RESULTING_NODE_OF_3+5)`
