You are given all the nodes of an **[N-ary tree](https://leetcode.com/articles/introduction-to-n-ary-trees/)** as an array of `Node` objects, where each node has a **unique value**.

Return _the **root** of the N-ary tree_.

**Custom testing:**

An N-ary tree can be serialized as represented in its level order traversal where each group of children is separated by the `null` value (see examples).

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/08/sample_4_964.png)

For example, the above tree is serialized as `[1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]`.

The testing will be done in the following way:

1.  The **input data** should be provided as a serialization of the tree.
2.  The driver code will construct the tree from the serialized input data and put each `Node` object into an array **in an arbitrary order**.
3.  The driver code will pass the array to `findRoot`, and your function should find and return the root `Node` object in the array.
4.  The driver code will take the returned `Node` object and serialize it. If the serialized value and the input data are the **same**, the test **passes**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: tree = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
Output: [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
Explanation: The tree from the input data is shown above.
The driver code creates the tree and gives findRoot the Node objects in an arbitrary order.
For example, the passed array could be [Node(5),Node(4),Node(3),Node(6),Node(2),Node(1)] or [Node(2),Node(6),Node(1),Node(3),Node(5),Node(4)].
The findRoot function should return the root Node(1), and the driver code will serialize it and compare with the input data.
The input data and serialized Node(1) are the same, so the test passes.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/08/sample_4_964.png)
```
Input: tree = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]
Output: [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]
```

**Constraints:**
-   The total number of nodes is between `[1, 5 * 104]`.
-   Each node has a **unique** value.

**Follow up:**
-   Could you solve this problem in constant space complexity with a linear time algorithm?

**Solution:**
- [x] [[Depth First Search]] + [[Hash Table]]

**Intuition** :

**Algorithm**

Given the above intuition, there are several ways to implement the idea.
Here we give one approach which has a space complexity of O(N) (where NN is the length of the input list).

We can use a Hash-set (named as `seen`) to keep track of all the **child** nodes that we visit, then at the end the root would not be in this set. We could find out the root node with **two iterations** as follows:
-   As the first iteration, we traverse the elements in the input list. For each element, we put its child nodes into the hash-set `seen`. Since the value of each node is unique, we could either put the node itself or simply its value into the hash-set.
-   Then, we visit the list once again. This time, we have all the child nodes in the hashes. Once we come across any node that is **NOT** in the hash-set, then this is the root node that we are looking for.

```
n = nodes in the tree

**Space Complexity** : O(n)

```java
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> children;

    
    public Node() {
        children = new ArrayList<Node>();
    }
    
    public Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
        children = new ArrayList<Node>();
    }
    
    public Node(int _val,ArrayList<Node> _children) {
        val = _val;
        children = _children;
    }
};

class Solution {
    Set<Node> candidate, visited;
    
    public Node findRoot(List<Node> trees) {
        candidate = new HashSet<>();
        visited = new HashSet<>();
        
        for (Node tree : trees) {
            candidate.add(tree);
            
            for (Node child : tree.children)
                traverse(child);
            
            if (visited.contains(tree))
                candidate.remove(tree);
        }
        return candidate.iterator().next();
    }
    private void traverse(Node node) {
        if (node == null || visited.contains(node)) return;
        
        if (candidate.contains(node))
            candidate.remove(node);
        
        visited.add(node);
        for (Node child : node.children)
            traverse(child);
    }
}
