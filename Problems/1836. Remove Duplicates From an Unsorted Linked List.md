Given the `head` of a linked list, find all the values that appear **more than once** in the list and delete the nodes that have any of those values.

Return _the linked list after the deletions._

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/21/tmp-linked-list.jpg)
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,2]
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: 2 appears twice in the linked list, so all 2's should be deleted. After deleting all 2's, we are left with [1,3].
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/21/tmp-linked-list-1.jpg)
```
Input: head = [2,1,1,2]
Output: []
Explanation: 2 and 1 both appear twice. All the elements should be deleted.
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/21/tmp-linked-list-2.jpg)
```
Input: head = [3,2,2,1,3,2,4]
Output: [1,4]
Explanation: 3 appears twice and 2 appears three times. After deleting all 3's and 2's, we are left with [1,4].
```

**Constraints:**
-   The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 105]`
-   `1 <= Node.val <= 105`

**Solution:**
- [x] [[Linked-List]]

**Intuition** :
The first pass is to collect counts for each value. The second - to skip nodes with values that appear more than once.
Note that we are using a temporary node as we may need to remove the head node.

```
n = length of linkedlist

**Time Complexity** : O(n)<br>
**Space Complexity** : O(1)

```java
    public ListNode deleteDuplicatesUnsorted(ListNode head) {
        
        Map<Integer, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
        for (ListNode iter = head; iter != null; iter = iter.next)
            freq.merge(iter.val, 1, Integer::sum);
        
        ListNode root = new ListNode(-1),
                 counter = root;
        
        for (ListNode iter = head; iter != null; iter = iter.next) {
            if (freq.get(iter.val) == 1) {
                counter.next = iter;
                counter = counter.next;
            }
        }
        counter.next = null;
        return root.next;
    }
```
