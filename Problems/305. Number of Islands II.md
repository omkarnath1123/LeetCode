You are given an empty 2D binary grid `grid` of size `m x n`. The grid represents a map where `0`'s represent water and `1`'s represent land. Initially, all the cells of `grid` are water cells (i.e., all the cells are `0`'s).

We may perform an add land operation which turns the water at position into a land. You are given an array `positions` where `positions[i] = [ri, ci]` is the position `(ri, ci)` at which we should operate the `ith` operation.

Return _an array of integers_ `answer` _where_ `answer[i]` _is the number of islands after turning the cell_ `(ri, ci)` _into a land_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/tmp-grid.jpg)

```
Input: m = 3, n = 3, positions = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,2],[2,1]]
Output: [1,1,2,3]
Explanation:
Initially, the 2d grid is filled with water.
- Operation #1: addLand(0, 0) turns the water at grid[0][0] into a land. We have 1 island.
- Operation #2: addLand(0, 1) turns the water at grid[0][1] into a land. We still have 1 island.
- Operation #3: addLand(1, 2) turns the water at grid[1][2] into a land. We have 2 islands.
- Operation #4: addLand(2, 1) turns the water at grid[2][1] into a land. We have 3 islands.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: m = 1, n = 1, positions = [[0,0]]
Output: [1]
```

**Constraints:**
-   `1 <= m, n, positions.length <= 104`
-   `1 <= m * n <= 104`
-   `positions[i].length == 2`
-   `0 <= ri < m`
-   `0 <= ci < n`

**Follow up:** Could you solve it in time complexity `O(k log(mn))`, where `k == positions.length`?


**Solution:**

- [x] [[Union-Find]]

**Intuition** :

Treat the 2d grid map as an undirected graph (formatted as adjacency matrix) and there is an edge between two horizontally or vertically adjacent nodes of value `1`, then the problem reduces to finding the number of connected components in the graph after each _addLand_ operation.

**Algorithm**
Make use of a `Union Find` data structure of size `m*n` to store all the nodes in the graph and initially each node's parent value is set to `-1` to represent an empty graph. Our goal is to update `Union Find` with lands added by _addLand_ operation and union lands belong to the same island.

For each _addLand_ operation at position (row, col), union it with its adjacent neighbors if they belongs to some islands, if none of its neighbors belong to any islands, then initialize the new position as a new island (set parent value to itself) within `Union Find`.
