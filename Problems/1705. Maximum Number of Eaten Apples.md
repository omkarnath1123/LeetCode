There is a special kind of apple tree that grows apples every day for `n` days. On the `ith` day, the tree grows `apples[i]` apples that will rot after `days[i]` days, that is on day `i + days[i]` the apples will be rotten and cannot be eaten. On some days, the apple tree does not grow any apples, which are denoted by `apples[i] == 0` and `days[i] == 0`.

You decided to eat **at most** one apple a day (to keep the doctors away). Note that you can keep eating after the first `n` days.

Given two integer arrays `days` and `apples` of length `n`, return _the maximum number of apples you can eat._

**Example 1:**
```
Input: apples = [1,2,3,5,2], days = [3,2,1,4,2]
Output: 7
Explanation: You can eat 7 apples:
- On the first day, you eat an apple that grew on the first day.
- On the second day, you eat an apple that grew on the second day.
- On the third day, you eat an apple that grew on the second day. After this day, the apples that grew on the third day rot.
- On the fourth to the seventh days, you eat apples that grew on the fourth day.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: apples = [3,0,0,0,0,2], days = [3,0,0,0,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can eat 5 apples:
- On the first to the third day you eat apples that grew on the first day.
- Do nothing on the fouth and fifth days.
- On the sixth and seventh days you eat apples that grew on the sixth day.
```

**Constraints:**
-   `n == apples.length == days.length`
-   `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`
-   `0 <= apples[i], days[i] <= 2 * 104`
-   `days[i] = 0` if and only if `apples[i] = 0`.

**Solution:**

- [x] [[Greedy]] + [[Heap]]

**Intuition** :
Firstly, we create an empty heap. Then go through each pair, add them into a heap, compare and pop unnecessary pairs.

```
n = is the length of apples
```
**Time Complexity** : O(n log(n))<br>
**Space Complexity** : O(n)

```java
    public int eatenApples(int[] apples, int[] days) {
        
        int eaten = 0,
            len = apples.length;
        PriorityQueue<Box> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();
        
        for (int i = 0;
               i < len || !minHeap.isEmpty();
               i++) {
            
            if (i < len)
                minHeap.add(new Box(apples[i], i + days[i]));
            
            while (!minHeap.isEmpty() && 
                   (minHeap.peek().apples == 0 || 
                    minHeap.peek().expiryDate <= i))
                minHeap.poll();
            
            if (!minHeap.isEmpty()) {
                minHeap.peek().apples--;
                eaten++;
            }
        }
        return eaten;
    }
    class Box implements Comparable<Box> {
        int apples, expiryDate;
        Box (int apples, int expiryDate) {
            this.apples = apples;
            this.expiryDate = expiryDate;
        }
        @Override
        public int compareTo(Box that) {
            return Integer.compare(this.expiryDate, that.expiryDate);
        }
    }
```
