Link: [778. Swim in Rising Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/swim-in-rising-water/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-11-03) <br>
Tag : **Hard**<br>
Lock: **Normal**

You are given an n x n integer matrix grid where each value grid[i][j] represents the elevation at that point (i, j).

It starts raining, and water gradually rises over time. At time t, the water level is t, meaning any cell with elevation less than equal to t is submerged or reachable.

You can swim from a square to another 4-directionally adjacent square if and only if the elevation of both squares individually are at most t. You can swim infinite distances in zero time. Of course, you must stay within the boundaries of the grid during your swim.

Return the minimum time until you can reach the bottom right square (n - 1, n - 1) if you start at the top left square (0, 0).

 

Example 1:

![[Pasted image 20260206105154.png]]
```
Input: grid = [[0,2],[1,3]]
Output: 3
Explanation:
At time 0, you are in grid location (0, 0).
You cannot go anywhere else because 4-directionally adjacent neighbors have a higher elevation than t = 0.
You cannot reach point (1, 1) until time 3.
When the depth of water is 3, we can swim anywhere inside the grid.
```

Example 2:
![[Pasted image 20260206105236.png]]
```
Input: grid = [[0,1,2,3,4],[24,23,22,21,5],[12,13,14,15,16],[11,17,18,19,20],[10,9,8,7,6]]
Output: 16
Explanation: The final route is shown.
We need to wait until time 16 so that (0, 0) and (4, 4) are connected.
```
 

Constraints:

n == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= n <= 50
0 <= grid[i][j] < n2
Each value grid[i][j] is unique.

**Solution:**

- [x] [[Heap]] + [[Depth First Search]]

## Detailed Intuition

We know that if every edge (directional) of our graph can exist, the shortest path is to never move at all. We always exist in the smallest way that it is directionally adjacent to ones we've visited.
When we reach the target, the largest number we've visited so far is the answer.

**Time Complexity** : O(n^2 log(n))<br>
**Space Complexity** : O(n^2)

```java
    int[][] dirs = new int[][]{
        {-1, 0}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {0, 1}

        int len = grid.length,
            bre = grid[0].length,

        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[len][bre];
        PriorityQueue<Cell> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();
        visited[0][0] = true;
        minHeap.add(new Cell(0, 0, grid[0][0]));

        while (!minHeap.isEmpty()) {
            Cell remove = minHeap.remove();
            height = Math.max(height, remove.height);
            if (remove.x == len - 1 && remove.y == bre - 1)
                return height;
