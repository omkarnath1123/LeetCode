Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return _the length of the longest substring of_ `s` _that contains at most_ `k` _**distinct** characters_.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "eceba", k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: The substring is "ece" with length 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "aa", k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The substring is "aa" with length 2.
```

**Constraints:**
-   `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
-   `0 <= k <= 50`

**Solution:**

- [x] [[Sliding Window]]

**Intuition** :
To solve the problem in one pass let's use here _sliding window_ approach with two set pointers `left` and `right` serving as the window boundaries.

The idea is to set both pointers in the position `0` and then move `right` pointer to the right while the window contains not more than `k` distinct characters. If at some point we've got `k + 1` distinct characters, let's move `left` pointer to keep not more than `k + 1` distinct characters in the window.

Basically that's the algorithm : to move sliding window along the string, to keep not more than `k` distinct characters in the window, and to update max substring length at each step.

> There is just one more question to reply - how to move the left pointer to keep only `k` distinct characters in the string?

Let's use for this purpose hash-map containing all characters in the sliding window as keys and their rightmost positions as values. At each moment, this hash-map could contain not more than `k + 1` elements.

![compute](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-most-k-distinct-characters/Figures/340/hash.png)

For example, using this hash-map one knows that the rightmost position of character `O` in `"LOVELEE"` window is `1` and so one has to move `left` pointer in the position `1 + 1 = 2` to exclude the character `O` from the sliding window.

**Algorithm**

Now one could write down the algorithm.

-   Return `0` if the string is empty or `k` is equal to zero.
-   Set both set pointers in the beginning of the string `left = 0` and `right = 0` and init max substring length `max_len = 1`.
-   While `right` pointer is less than `N`:
    -   Add the current character `s[right]` in the hash-map and move `right` pointer to the right.
    -   If hash-map contains `k + 1` distinct characters, remove the leftmost character from the hash-map and move the `left` pointer so that sliding window contains again `k` distinct characters only.
    -   Update `max_len`.

```
n = no. of characters in the string
```
**Time Complexity** : O(n)<br>
**Space Complexity** : O(n)

```java
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstringKDistinct(String source, int k) {
        
        int len = source.length(),
            start = 0,
            maxLen = 0;
        Map<Character, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (int end = 0; end < len; end++) {
            char ch = source.charAt(end);
            freq.merge(ch, 1, Integer::sum);
            
            while (start <= end && freq.size() > k) {
                char prev = source.charAt(start);
                freq.merge(prev, -1, Integer::sum);
                if (freq.get(prev) == 0) freq.remove(prev);
                start++;
            }
            
            maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, end - start + 1);
        }
        return maxLen;
    }
```
