Tag : **Medium**<br>
Lock: **Normal**

Anti-theft security devices are activated inside a bank. You are given a **0-indexed** binary string array `bank` representing the floor plan of the bank, which is an `m x n` 2D matrix. `bank[i]` represents the `ith` row, consisting of `'0'`s and `'1'`s. `'0'` means the cell is empty, while`'1'` means the cell has a security device.

There is **one** laser beam between any **two** security devices **if both** conditions are met:

-   The two devices are located on two **different rows**: `r1` and `r2`, where `r1 < r2`.
-   For **each** row `i` where `r1 < i < r2`, there are **no security devices** in the `ith` row.

Laser beams are independent, i.e., one beam does not interfere nor join with another.

Return _the total number of laser beams in the bank_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/24/laser1.jpg)

```
Input: bank = ["011001","000000","010100","001000"]
Output: 8
Explanation: Between each of the following device pairs, there is one beam. In total, there are 8 beams:
 * bank[0][1] -- bank[2][1]
 * bank[0][1] -- bank[2][3]
 * bank[0][2] -- bank[2][1]
 * bank[0][2] -- bank[2][3]
 * bank[0][5] -- bank[2][1]
 * bank[0][5] -- bank[2][3]
 * bank[2][1] -- bank[3][2]
 * bank[2][3] -- bank[3][2]
Note that there is no beam between any device on the 0th row with any on the 3rd row.
This is because the 2nd row contains security devices, which breaks the second condition.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/24/laser2.jpg)

```
Input: bank = ["000","111","000"]
Output: 0
Explanation: There does not exist two devices located on two different rows.
```

**Constraints:**
-   `m == bank.length`
-   `n == bank[i].length`
-   `1 <= m, n <= 500`
-   `bank[i][j]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.


**Solution:**
- [x] [[Math]]

**Intuition** :
To find the total number of `laser beams` we have to do 2 things:
1.  Find the `number of laser beams` between 'adjacent rows'. A row here is considered only if it has atleast 1 `security device`. Otherwise the row is simply ignored.  
    Thus if:  
    Row `1`: 3 security devices  
    Row `2`: 0 security devices  
    Row `3`: 2 security devices  
    We can ignore row `2` and say that row `1` is adjacent to row `3`. To find the `number of laser beams` between 'adjacent rows' we can multiply the number of security devices in the first row of the pair to the number of security devices in the second row of the pair.
2.  Doing step 1 only solves a part of the problem. We now need to find the sum of all the `laser beams` from each pair of 'adjacent rows'.

**Algorithm**:  
For each string in bank:
-   `count` = number of ones in string
-   Multiply `count` by the non-zero `count` of previous string and add it to `ans`

```
n = length of bank
m = length of string
```
**Time Complexity** : O(m*n)<br>
**Space Complexity** : O(1)

```java
    public int numberOfBeams(String[] bank) {
        
        int prev = 0, curr = 0, lasers = 0;
        for (String row : bank) {
            
            int device = getDeviceCount(row);
            if (device != 0) {
                prev = curr;
                curr = device;
                lasers += prev * curr;
            }
        }
        return lasers;
    }
    private int getDeviceCount(String row) {
        int count = 0;
        for (char ch : row.toCharArray())
            if (ch == '1')
                count++;
        return count;
    }
```
