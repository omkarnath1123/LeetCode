Link: [582. Kill Process](https://leetcode.com/problems/kill-process/) <br>
Tag : **Medium**<br>
Lock: **Premium**

You have `n` processes forming a rooted tree structure. You are given two integer arrays `pid` and `ppid`, where `pid[i]` is the ID of the `ith` process and `ppid[i]` is the ID of the `ith` process's parent process.

Each process has only **one parent process** but may have multiple children processes. Only one process has `ppid[i] = 0`, which means this process has **no parent process** (the root of the tree).

When a process is **killed**, all of its children processes will also be killed.

Given an integer `kill` representing the ID of a process you want to kill, return _a list of the IDs of the processes that will be killed. You may return the answer in **any order**._

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/24/ptree.jpg)
```
Input: pid = [1,3,10,5], ppid = [3,0,5,3], kill = 5
Output: [5,10]
Explanation: The processes colored in red are the processes that should be killed.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: pid = [1], ppid = [0], kill = 1
Output: [1]
```

**Constraints:**
-   `n == pid.length`
-   `n == ppid.length`
-   `1 <= n <= 5 * 104`
-   `1 <= pid[i] <= 5 * 104`
-   `0 <= ppid[i] <= 5 * 104`
-   Only one process has no parent.
-   All the values of `pid` are **unique**.
-   `kill` is **guaranteed** to be in `pid`.

**Solution:**

- [x] [[Depth First Search]]

**Intuition** :
Think of it as a tree and now create a dictionary of ppid. Key is ppid and values are the list of its immediate children.  
Now search through the dictionary in BFS fashion to get all the processes that will be killed.

```java
    Map<Integer, Node> nodes;
    public List<Integer> killProcess(List<Integer> pid, List<Integer> ppid, int kill) {
        initilizeTree(pid, ppid);
        Set<Integer> killed = new HashSet<>();
        depthFirstSearch(kill, killed);
        return new LinkedList<>(killed);
    }
    private void depthFirstSearch(int source, Set<Integer> killed) {
        killed.add(source);
        
        Node node = nodes.getOrDefault(source, null);
        if (node == null) return;
        for (int child : node.child)
            depthFirstSearch(child, killed);
    }
    private void initilizeTree(List<Integer> pid, List<Integer> ppid) {
        nodes = new HashMap<>();
        int size = pid.size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            int parent = ppid.get(i),
                process = pid.get(i);
            
            nodes.computeIfAbsent(parent, item -> {
                Node node = new Node(parent);
                node.child.add(process);
                return node;
            });
            nodes.get(parent).child.add(process);
        }
    }
    class Node {
        int val;
        Set<Integer> child = new HashSet<>();
        Node (int val) {
            this.val = val;
        }
    }
