Tag : **Medium**<br>
Lock: **Normal**

There is an **undirected** graph with `n` nodes, where each node is numbered between `0` and `n - 1`. You are given a 2D array `graph`, where `graph[u]` is an array of nodes that node `u` is adjacent to. More formally, for each `v` in `graph[u]`, there is an undirected edge between node `u` and node `v`. The graph has the following properties:

-   There are no self-edges (`graph[u]` does not contain `u`).
-   There are no parallel edges (`graph[u]` does not contain duplicate values).
-   If `v` is in `graph[u]`, then `u` is in `graph[v]` (the graph is undirected).
-   The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes `u` and `v` such that there is no path between them.

A graph is **bipartite** if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets `A` and `B` such that **every** edge in the graph connects a node in set `A` and a node in set `B`.

Return `true` _if and only if it is **bipartite**_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/21/bi2.jpg)
```
Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,2]]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no way to partition the nodes into two independent sets such that every edge connects a node in one and a node in the other.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/21/bi1.jpg)
```
Input: graph = [[1,3],[0,2],[1,3],[0,2]]
Output: true
Explanation: We can partition the nodes into two sets: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.
```

**Constraints:**
-   `graph.length == n`
-   `1 <= n <= 100`
-   `0 <= graph[u].length < n`
-   `0 <= graph[u][i] <= n - 1`
-   `graph[u]` does not contain `u`.
-   All the values of `graph[u]` are **unique**.
-   If `graph[u]` contains `v`, then `graph[v]` contains `u`.

**Solution:**

- [x] [[Depth First Search]]

**Intuition** :

Color a node blue if it is part of the first set, else red. We should be able to greedily color the graph if and only if it is bipartite: one node being blue implies all it's neighbors are red, all those neighbors are blue, and so on.

**Algorithm**

We'll keep an array (or hashmap) to lookup the color of each node: `color[node]`. The colors could be `0`, `1`, or uncolored (`-1` or `null`).

We should be careful to consider disconnected components of the graph, by searching each node. For each uncolored node, we'll start the coloring process by doing a depth-first-search on that node. Every neighbor gets colored the opposite color from the current node. If we find a neighbor colored the same color as the current node, then our coloring was impossible.

            if (!colorMap.containsKey(i)) {
                if (!depthFirstSearch(i, Color.RED))
                    return false;

    }
    private boolean depthFirstSearch(int node, Color nextColor) {
        if (colorMap.containsKey(node))
            return colorMap.get(node) == nextColor;
        
        Color next = nextColor == Color.RED ? Color.BLUE : Color.RED;
        colorMap.put(node, nextColor);
        for (int neighbour : graph.getOrDefault(node, new LinkedList<>()))
            if (!depthFirstSearch(neighbour, next))
                return false;
        
        return true;
    }
    private void initilizeGraph(int[][] edges) {
        graph = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < edges.length; i++)
            for (int neighbour : edges[i])
                graph.computeIfAbsent(i, item -> new LinkedList<>()).add(neighbour);
    }
