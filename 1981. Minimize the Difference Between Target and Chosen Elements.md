Lock: [[Normal]]

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `mat` and an integer `target`.

Choose one integer from **each row** in the matrix such that the **absolute difference** between `target` and the **sum** of the chosen elements is **minimized**.

Return _the **minimum absolute difference**_.

The **absolute difference** between two numbers `a` and `b` is the absolute value of `a - b`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: mat = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]], target = 13
Output: 0
Explanation: One possible choice is to:
- Choose 1 from the first row.
- Choose 5 from the second row.
- Choose 7 from the third row.
The sum of the chosen elements is 13, which equals the target, so the absolute difference is 0.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/03/matrix1-1.png)

```
Input: mat = [[1],[2],[3]], target = 100
Output: 94
Explanation: The best possible choice is to:
- Choose 1 from the first row.
- Choose 2 from the second row.
- Choose 3 from the third row.
The sum of the chosen elements is 6, and the absolute difference is 94.
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/03/matrix1-3.png)

```
Input: mat = [[1,2,9,8,7]], target = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: The best choice is to choose 7 from the first row.
The absolute difference is 1.
```

**Constraints:**
-   `m == mat.length`
-   `n == mat[i].length`
-   `1 <= m, n <= 70`
-   `1 <= mat[i][j] <= 70`
-   `1 <= target <= 800`

**Solution:**

- [x] Dynamic Programming

**[[Intution]] :**
-   Looking at the constraints we can surely think of a brute force approach, which we can later optimize.
-   Now, in the question we are asked to pick a element from each row and find the total sum. Then, out of all possible combinations, we have to return the one whose absolute difference with target is minimum.
    -   i.e abs(target - sum) is minimum
    -   Also, sum can be _greater than or less than_ target

In these type of problems where we need to find all the possible combinations, try to solve it recusively by formulating a **recursive formula**.
```
minAbsoluteDiff = min({all possbile sums}) -> there can be n^m possible sums.
```
So, we need to start picking every element for each row and add it to current path sum, and get the sum. And recursively call for next row along with path sum.
```
	solve(mat, idx+1, sum+mat[idx][j], target)
```
In the end (base case) when we reach `(i == n)`, simply return absolute difference of target with sum.


```
m == mat.length
n == mat[i].length
```
**[[Time Complexity]]** : O(n * m)
**[[Space Complexity]]** : O(n * m)

```java
    Integer[][] store;
    public int minimizeTheDifference(int[][] mat, int target) {
        
        int len = mat.length;
        store = new Integer[len][5001];
        return backTrack(mat, 0, target, 0);
    }
    private int backTrack(int[][] mat, int depth, int target, int sum) {
        if (depth == mat.length)
            return Math.abs(target - sum);
        
        if (store[depth][sum] != null)
            return store[depth][sum];
        
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < mat[0].length; i++)
            min = Math.min(min, backTrack(mat, depth + 1, target, sum + mat[depth][i]));
        
        store[depth][sum] = min;
        return min;
    }
```
